        interview: `<strong>Q. We would like to know which company you are placed in and what is
          the job profile and the field that the set job belongs to?</strong>
          <br>
          >> Talking about the 6 month internship, I have an offer in adobe
          with the job profile being that of a product engineer and I have
          been offered full time employment in Harman, Banglore and it deals
          with connected cars, both being software profile jobs.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Tell us something about your college life Ma'am, like the
          experiences etc.</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> My college life was pretty awesome.I guess it's an irreplaceable
          time of one's life. Great friends to hang out with, parties and even
          the late night study sessions to meet assignment deadlines will be
          missed.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Were you a part of any club or any society throughout your
          college life and how did it help you in your college life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> So this I would like to share that I wasn’t a part of any club or
          society but it is very important that you should be a part of it
          because through that you can gain a lot of knowledge and apart from
          knowledge you can have lots of fun too. So it is crucial that you
          become a part of any club or society.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How did you manage your academic and social life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> EEE as a branch is not that scary as it sounds like.One can keep
          up a decent gpa just by putting in a little bit of effort (take this
          from me I have always been a “last moment studier”). The teachers we
          have had were quiet liberal and did not burden us except for the
          labs which almost took up our entire day. Trust me when I say that
          maintaining a lab record with neatly written experiment , precisely
          measured circuit diagram and properly covered copy was a every lab
          challenge. Even after this I could gather enough time leisure time
          in the weekends and would on outings with my friends.I suggest you
          should enjoy and have a social life and not just bury under the
          burden of academics. Just don’t become a geek and study all the
          time. College is very crucial time and so you should enjoy it to the
          fullest.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the technical skills that are important for a EEE
          graduate?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> You should have a sound knowledge of your core subjects and
          that’s quite important for a EEE student. You need not know it all,
          enlist the domain that interests you and dig deeper into it. Surface
          knowledge lands you nowhere . You have your internships coming up in
          third year and TATA STEEL is the best shot got so prepare well for
          it. Apart from that study your subjects well, listen to your
          teachers in class and do well in the projects that are mentored by
          EEESoc.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How important are internships and where did you do our
          internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> In the software field, try grabbing an internship in any of the
          dream companies that visit the campus in the third year, but its not
          a necessity. Preparing thoroughly in the 2 months of time that you
          have, will help you a lot during your placements. I did my training
          rather than internship in HP.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the projects that you have done in 4 years and how did
          they help you in your placement?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> My journey started off in the electrical domain ,to begin with, I
          did a core project titled “SMART ENERGY METER” under the Student
          Mentorship Program and I also did a project on Power Electronics
          that was asked by our teachers do as an assignment .Through this I
          learnt that core electrical was clearly not my area of interest , so
          I switched to software profile .Having prior knowledge of coding was
          an added benefit.Firstly I did a project on Web development. If you
          are intrigued by web development then you can learn the basics by
          watching videos on youtube. I had attended a 2-3 day training
          workshop on android in IIT Kharagpur and from knowledge gathered
          from there and little bit of my own efforts I made an “Attendance
          App” and lastly I did a project on Big data .
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What advice would you give to the students who have an interest
          in coding but are in EEE and also how should they apply for the
          companies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Have a clear mindset and be sure about where your interest lies.
          I guess figuring this out is the most important step. Rest all lies
          in your hardwork and how ambitious you are in achieving your goals.
          Hailing from electrical branch where your exposure to software
          profile is almost nil, hardwork and dedication are the only assets
          you have. So practice competitive coding as much as you can.Clear
          your basics and then go for advanced topics. Having good projects in
          your kitty will always earn you brownie points in the interview.The
          two months that you get in your third year are very crucial, I did
          most of my projects and learning during that time and it helped me a
          lot later. Study hard for the company that you actually want to get
          placed in and prepare for it acccordingly.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What were the various stages you had to go to for placements and
          how many rounds were held and how did you prepare for them?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I had faced a couple of rejections before I got my internship at
          Adobe, which was actually a dream come true. Adobe being a
          prestigious and a dream company was always in my bucket list. The
          1st round was the coding round that was held on Hackerrank platform
          where we were given a coding question to solve. It was based on
          dynamic programming. I would advice everyone to have a sound
          knowledge of dynamic programming, it being the most frequently asked
          question in coding round of top companies. So I would advice
          everyone to prepare DP very well and then there were MCQs related to
          subject knowledge of CS IT branches, and the most focused topics
          being DBMS, Operating Systems ,Computer network and SQL.. These are
          the four mandatory topics if you’re really routing for a software
          profile you people are expected to know that. Last was a theory
          answer in which I was asked to write about IOT . There was a call
          back the other day that we had to send in our resume and about 12
          other people were shortlisted for the next round, the telephonic
          round. The day before Adobe’s interview round , I remember I had
          given the online test of Harman(the company in which I have been
          offered FTE). It was an exhaustive 4hr test after which I went
          straight to preparing for adobe’s interview process. The interview
          began with a discussion on data structure, question was asked about
          Queues and its applications. Then he asked me to implement it my
          android project and suggest a situation where this could be
          implemented. Then he asked me some basic coding questions. And then
          he questioned me on my big data project and then he asked me about
          the insights of project, how have I made it and what are the skills
          required and everything and then he asked me about the
          implementations and asked me to provide a scenario where it would be
          of use in the real world. Then he asked me about my interests. Do
          prepare a good introduction speech. Talking about my interview
          experience in Harman, there was one technical round and one HR round
          . In the technical round he asked me about OOPS concept and a
          discussion about the basics of programming. A brief description
          about all the projects I had done.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Were you asked any subject related questions? Any out of the box
          question was asked in the interview round and HR round? Does
          vocational training help in grabbing good placements?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Apart from the general coding questions the thorough knowledge of
          projects is important . And yeah vocational training is quiet
          important I suppose. I did a project on big data and to my luck
          there was an entire team working on big data software. This, I think
          played a major role in getting me through the interview. So it is
          quite important.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. From a decent cgpa what other skills do you think are the most
          sought after by the company in the students while incurcuting?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The technical skills are must, you must be proficient with
          whatever you learn and have proper and indepth knowledge . I have
          seen people getting rejected in HR interviews also. So it is
          important that you develop good communication skills also.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher
          studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Somewhere in the back of my mind that I want to do MBA. Firstly I
          want to explore the software field and see if I fit in right .
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What is your advice to juniors who wants to get placed in Adobe?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Have a strong hold on coding.Prepare the topics like OS ,DBMS etc
          well and do projects in the field that interests you. Beleive in
          yourself and don't give up on things and to top of it all cherish
          the time you have in college as time it ain't coming back.`,

        interview: `<strong>Q1. Tell us something about your college life and experiences.</strong>
          <br>
          >>For me college life acted as a transition into a more confident,
          outgoing and a better individual. These four years were full of good
          as well as not so good experiences that helped me know myself and
          the people around me better. I made some good friends and many
          memories here, some of which will always bring a broad smile on my
          face. These years were full of ups and downs but I know they will
          always be the best years of my life.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q2. Tell us about the company in which you are placed.</strong>
          <br>
          >>I am placed in IBM which stands for International Business
          Machine. It is an American multinational information technology
          company which produces and sells computer hardware, middleware and
          software. I will be joining the company as an associate developer.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q3. Tell us about the selection procedure of the company.</strong>
          <br>
          >>The selection procedure of IBM was very different from other
          software companies. It comprised of quantitative aptitude, verbal
          ability and coding round. The quantitative aptitude round comprised
          of some games based on mental maths. It was easy to clear this
          round. The verbal ability round comprised of some comprehensions and
          English language questions. The last and the final round was the
          coding round in which there were 2 coding questions and some MCQ
          based on OS and DBMS.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q4. How should the students prepare for the same?</strong>
          <br>
          >>Many software companies visit our college. They start coming from
          July end and the companies come without any break. Sometimes we had
          to answer two tests in a day. So, aspirants should prepare seriously
          during their summer break after the 6th semester. As I have already
          mentioned the online test of IBM consists of 3 rounds namely
          quantitative aptitude, verbal ability and coding round.
          The selection process of IBM was little different from other
          companies; like in the quantitative aptitude round there were games
          based on mental maths which checked your focus and was basically a
          fun exercise to make the brain muscles most efficient to do well in
          the upcoming rounds.
          The next round was verbal ability round and it comprised of some
          passages, and questions on synonyms, antonyms, preposition,
          conjunction etc. Refer to some good books and websites for this. I
          practiced it from IndiaBix.
          The last and the final round was the coding round. In this round
          everyone was given 2 coding questions and some MCQs. No two people
          were given the same questions. The level of questions range from
          easy to Moderately difficult. To prepare for this round and coding
          round of all other companies I Practiced competitive programming
          from CodeMonk. The aspirants should have good knowledge of Data
          structures & Algorithms and a little knowledge of Dynamic
          programming to clear the coding round. MCQs were based on subjects
          like Operating Systems, DBMS etc. Refer to geeksforgeeks and videos
          of Sanchit Jain for indepth understanding of the subjects. Some
          websites likes Daily coding problem provide a good question bank of
          coding questions asked in companies like Facebook, Google.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q5. What is the role of projects in placements? What are the
          projects that you did?</strong>
          <br>
          >>Projects are really important, especially when you are not from
          CSE or IT as it shows that you are really interested in the software
          field and are working hard to do what you are passionate about. Your
          projects makes you stand out when you compete with others who have
          cleared the rounds and are going to face the interview.
          My journey started with initiating the process of making a website
          for EEESoc and through this I gained interest in web development and
          did basic front end web development by myself. Then I made some
          projects on app development, my main project being Expense manager
          which was a database based project and I used SQL for it. Before
          this I had attented a 2-3 day workshop at IIT KHARAGPUR on App
          Development and then I did a training in RCPL to have complete
          knowledge of App development.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q6. What were the clubs you were part of? Do club activities in
          general impact placement?</strong>
          <br>
          >>I feel to some extent there is an absolute necessity to be a part
          of a club of a certain origin. I am not a club enthusiast. In my 4
          years I realised that clubs do mend up our interpersonal
          communication. I recommend every student to be a part of a club,
          gain experience being a part of the team and most importantly have a
          lot of fun. Clubs make us confident and I strongly feel being
          confident is an important trait in any interview for coding and
          development firms.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q7. How important is CGPA for placements?</strong>
          <br>
          >>CGPA is a resemblance of how well one performs at understanding
          the branch subjects. It is not that significant in coding firms
          because your skills speak more than your grade point does. A decent
          CGPA is a good to have asset that is garnished by fine knowledge of
          coding principles.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q8. What are the companies visiting the campus?</strong>
          <br>
          >>BIT is the land of opportunities for a person who codes and wishes
          to pursue it as a career. From investment, and banking to
          development profiles, there are many giants, mid range and good
          going startups too that visit our campus. I recommend you all to be
          patient in the placement season and have faith in yourself. Your
          skills and knowledge will eventually payoff one day.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q9. What are your future plans? Do you plan for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
          >>I currently wish to be a part of the corporate world, and see what
          it feels like and gain important work experience before going for
          higher studies. I am planning to pursue MBA in future after gaining
          significant experience. I also have a feeling that one should take a
          while to understand whether a PG degree is more effective for him or
          her as compared to the work experience he or she is gaining
          everyday.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Q10. What advice you would like to give to your juniors?</strong>
          <br>
          >>To my beloved juniors I just want to say learn and have fun. Be
          participative, actively involved in many places and seek practical
          knowledge from all the possible places. Keep practicing coding
          everyday like one exercises. Refer competitive coding sites, work on
          projects, gain knowledge through courses and most importantly have
          fun in the process. You'll feel lost and bored quite often, so I
          suggest you all to enjoy your hobby as well, hangout with friends
          and cherish the beautiful college years and the memories you'll
          make. PS- I'm a young mind myself.`,

          Engineer.

          <strong>Q2. What skills are required for this profile?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Competitive Coding is a must. You should know about Data
          Structures and Algorithms, and not just the logical part but you
          should be able to write codes as well. During interviews, you are
          first asked the logic and then the code. I was asked a bit about my
          project and dynamic programming. I had mentioned Web Development and
          Cloud Computing in my resume. I was asked how I have implemented
          them in my project, why have I used the MongoDb Database and not
          SQL?</strong> I was only asked technical questions, and, from Web Development
          all the questions were how and where have I implemented them.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q3. What was your project about?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> If you name the project it was e-portal for local shopkeepers.
          Nowadays online shopping is preferred everywhere so we tried to
          provide an app to local shopkeepers in which they can upload the
          pictures to the site and then they will be notified in their feeds
          about the kind of products the customer is demanding and via this
          app, the shopkeepers could respond if they have the product or not
          or will the product be available in near future in their shops. If
          the shopkeeper clicks No, then the notification will be removed from
          their device and if they click Yes then the customer will get the
          information in their feed that the product is available in the given
          shop along with the address and location of the shop using Google
          Maps. Our project was mainly a Web App for clothes.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q4. Tell us a bit about your college experience.</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I was always interested in coding even in school and this thing 
          carried with me to college as well. I attended all the coding
          workshops in college. After the first semester, I felt like I won't
          be able to continue coding as I have not joined any coding club.
          Then I started again in my 3rd semester because I wanted to get an
          internship in 3rd year but when I shifted to competitive programming
          it was a whole new world, very difficult and confusing all at the
          same time. My solutions were rejected on various coding platforms.
          So that phase was very disheartening and after that, I gave up on
          coding. Then I started learning Networking. After consulting a few
          seniors I came to know about Cloud Computing, and in 4th sem, I went
          to Jaipur to study it further. I learned a bit about Linux, Cloud
          Computing and Networking but I didn't find Networking that
          interesting. Then in the 5th semester, I started applying for
          internship interviews for various companies and that is when I
          realized that for any company you need to know Competitive Coding. I
          qualified for the interview of Microland but they wanted in-depth
          knowledge of Cloud Computing so I was discarded. After this, I
          switched to coding once again. After consulting a few seniors I came
          to know about Codeasylums in Pune started by a K12 senior of BIT
          Mesra itself. I consider this as my first step towards placement.
          They taught everything from scratch including Data Structures and
          Algorithms. They introduced me to JavaScript and HTML. They taught
          me React & Node. Mostly people prefer JS for Web Development but
          once you get introduced to React & Node you will prefer this over
          JS. React & Node I think is highly in demand right now in the
          market. Even Facebook works on React and now every company is
          looking for React Developers. So its scope is vast. So they taught
          everything from Scratch and Personally I think it was the best
          career decision that I made. Again in the 6th semester, I started to
          code and for the next 7-8 months, I put all the efforts in coding
          and revising everything I was taught. So this is how my journey was.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q5. How important are clubs according to you?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I joined the Music Club and then I was in Rotaract. I don't think
          clubs matter that much. Clubs just help you in creating contacts
          with the seniors and this I think you can do even if you are not a
          part of any club. In terms of placement, clubs don't help that much.
          For me, college is more about enjoying yourself. I have enjoyed 5
          semesters of my college life a lot. Try maintaining a decent CGPA.
          Grades matter a lot.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q6. What according to you is a decent CGPA and how difficult was it
          for you to maintain your grades coming from EEE branch?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Coding companies require a CGPA of a minimum of 7. Above 7
          everyone gets to sit for the interviews and placements so 7 CGPA is
          a must. Few companies allow students above 6 CGPA but most of the
          companies go for 7 and a few for 7.5 CGPA. Microsoft, Goldman Sachs
          & OYO Rooms have criteria of 7 CGPA. In my 1st semester I scored a
          GPA of 8.66 as I wanted to apply for a branch upgrade to Computer
          Science and next semester I scored 7.83 GPA and so my branch
          continued to remain EEE. Electrical Core has never interested me. I
          used to prepare a night before exams. I know nothing about machines
          or my Core subjects. EEE is not tough if you are interested in the
          subjects and a night or two before the exam was sufficient for me to
          memorize. My entire goal after placement was to enjoy my college
          life with my friends. I used to be punctual in Labs as I know I can
          fetch some marks there. So, Coding for me was the best option I had.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q7. What advice do you give to your juniors to maintain their
          academic as well as social life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I am a very social person. I have worked in clubs and have a huge
          friend circle. And as far as academics were concerned I was pretty
          confident that I will manage decent marks in them. All you need to
          do is to dedicate a whole night and learn the subjects so that you
          fetch a decent grade. Academics are not that tough if you are
          confident and a bit self-conscious about your studies.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q8. What all rounds did you clear for OYO rooms?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The first round for any company is a coding round, followed by
          two technical rounds where you are asked proper technical questions
          and are asked to write code on a sheet of paper after writing the
          logic. So if you want to crack interviews practice writing code on
          paper so that you get clarity with your logic. During my Microsoft
          campus rounds, I was not in the habit of writing code on paper so
          that was a disadvantage for me. In many companies, there is one more
          round known as HR round but in OYO rooms there was no HR round. They
          asked coding questions, a bit of MongoDB, OS and second techincal
          round was almost the same. It all depends on how well you have
          practiced and how many questions you have solved.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q9. What advice would you give to students who have an interest in
          coding but are in EEE and also should they apply for the companies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> It is not a thing about branch for me, during the placement
          procedure 9 out of 10 companies allow EEE to sit. If you have the
          interest and determination you would surely get placed. Also, I
          wasn’t even asked about my branch. So, according to me, one should
          have a fair knowledge about the theory of OS, DBMS, computer
          networks. Apart from that, you should do Competitive Programming
          that is very very important. One should also take part in contests
          on CodeForces and HackerEarth I guess that’ll be very helpful.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q10. Was any out of the box question asked in the interview round?
          Also, does vocational training help in grabbing good placements?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Not really in case of OYO rooms I was asked a bit about my
          projects but nothing that was out of the box. For vocational skills,
          I would say that it is very important as one should be able to tell
          his point of view. The ratio for technical to vocational skills
          would 70:30 but still, you should be capable. Microsoft tests you
          completely they would even test your personality, they would see if
          you are capable enough to lead a team or not.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q11. What was it like to study in your major?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Frankly speaking, I had no interest in the field of core
          Electrical and Electronics. For me studying in my major was all
          about passing exams. I don’t have any great knowledge of machines
          and electronics. I had more interest in coding and so I was quite
          clear about what I had to do.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q12. What are your plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I don’t have any plans as of now, I would like to explore the
          field and see more about it. Also, I could switch in the near future
          so that is one thing.`,

        interview: `<strong>1.Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong>
          <br>
          >> I have been placed in Walmart Labs for software development. My designation is SDE-II.Labs is basically the tech arm of Walmart.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>2.Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you part of any clubs or societies throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
          >> I had an amazing college life and a group of close friends throughout. These friends have been a great influence, and I am grateful to them for making my college life fulfilling. Yes,I was a part of Photographic Society (PSoc) and a couple of other clubs. Participating in activities as a member of PSoc was a major part of my college life, and I have a good bonding with my seniors as well as juniors there.
          <br><br>
          
          <strong>3. What message would you give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
          <br>
          >> It is very important to maintain decent grades. The first criteria that companies use to select students for internships or placements is your academic GPA, so it is very important to maintain a decent GPA of at least 7 or above. As for social life, be an active member of whatever club you are associated with. It is the place where you can make new social connections and friends, not to mention gain valuable mentorship from seniors. Try to interact with people everywhere. At the end of the day, this will help you not just in your personal life, but in your professional life as well. Don’t limit yourselves; explore everything and have fun.
          <br><br>
          <strong>4.How do you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How do you carry forward in this?</strong>
          <br>
          >>Give every field a try, whatever strikes your interest. Only once that you have a first-hand experience of different fields, will you be able to judge whether you are good in it or not. This experience is extremely valuable. Always try to explore more and more, one never knows what might interest you. Never stop learning.In my case, this led to me finding out about programming and software development, film making, and photography as fields I really like.
          <br><br>
          <strong>5.What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
          <br>
          >>I am not the best person to answer this, because most of my knowledge is in other fields like software development and computer science. But as a EEE graduate, you should know the basics. For example, if someone asks you about Ohm’s Law or “What is resistance?</strong>”, you should have an answer ready. But the most important thing is to be proficient in whatever field or specialization you are most interested in. Having a ‘T’ shaped knowledge, as in having a general idea of many fields, with deep knowledge in one particular niche is the best.
          <br><br>
          <strong>6.How early should one start preparation for internships, and how important is an internship? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
          <br>
          >> I didn’t have any internship in my 3rd year. But I had peers with internships, and I can say that internships in 3rd year are definitely beneficial. One major advantage is that the majority of the companies offer PPOs after the internship, after which you do not have to sit for placements in your 4th year. Not to mention, internships are a great learning opportunity.If, like me, you do not manage to get an internship in your 3rd year, don’t get disheartened. It is okay, and you will get many opportunities. Use this time to prepare yourself so that you can seize whatever further opportunities you get.Adding to this, it’s always better to start early. I started my preparation in the winter break in my 3rd year, with the corona-vacation comprising of the bulk of studying. However, for software companies, starting 2–3 months before the placement season is fine, provided you can devote enough time to studying every day.
          <br><br>
          <strong>7.What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
          >>I had done a little bit of coding in my 1st year, mostly due to the good competitive coding culture in our college. After my first year, I got engaged in other activities (mostly photography and graphic design), and programming was placed on the back burner.However, in my 3rd year, I started 100 days of code, which I’ll say was the stepping-stone leading to my comeback to programming. I learned android programming and backend development and made a basic chat app, a WhatsApp clone. During this lockdown I made a couple more projects, one of which was a Physics Engine. This project was something unique that is not commonly attempted by many. Interviewers were intrigued with this project, and anything that makes you stand out from the crowd, is an advantage.
          <br><br>
          <strong>8.What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
          >>The selection procedure for Walmart consisted of an online test, followed by 4 rounds of interviews.The online test consisted of one question related to data structures and algorithms, and MCQs consisting of aptitude questions, and questions from CS subjects like operating systems, database systems, and computer networking. It was important that you perform well in both the sections in the limited time to get short listed.The interview rounds tested my knowledge of algorithms and data structures, and computer science in general. The last two interviews also focused on behavioral skills.
          <br><br>
          <strong>9.How to choose and apply for internships, so that we can make our way in the right company that we want to join?</strong>
          <br>
          >>First thing, you need to know yourself — the fields you are interested in. After that, it is a matter of simple research about the companies where opportunities are available. Many of these companies also visit our college for placements. Once you have this part down, make sure to prepare yourself accordingly. There will be many opportunities, make sure that you have the preparation to benefit.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>10. Please tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of our college.</strong>
          <br>
          >>In third year, access is provided to the TnP Portal. Announcements regarding companies, career events and dates are posted there.
          <br><br>
          <strong>11.What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
          >>In the immediate future, I’d like to gain some experience in the corporate world. After that, I would love to do my master’s from abroad.
          <br><br>
          <strong>12.“Every coin has two sides”. Despite knowing the demerits of IT sector, why did you choose this?</strong>
          <br>
          >>There is one simple fact: wherever you are, there is always someone or something better. One should strive to be always learning, always making progress in whatever field they are in, and external demerits will not matter.`,

        interview: `<strong>1. What company have you been placed in and What is your job description?</strong>
          <br>
          => I got a 6-months internship and FTE offer from Walmart Global Tech as a Software Engineer — II.
          <br><br>
          <strong>2. Tell us Something about your college life and experiences. Were you part of any clubs and Society and how did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
          => Most of my college life revolved around my friends. Right from my first year, I was a part of many clubs like Rotaract, Robolution, Ehsaas Dramatic Society, NAPS, and LEO. I participated in lots of events and activities. Clubs helped me in connecting with a lot of people. I came to the BIT Mesra as a Production Engineering Student and because of a good GPA in my first year, my branch got upgraded to EEE. At the end of 1st Year, I attended a Bootcamp at Codeasylum Pune and where I learned Web Development and Basic Data Structure and Algorithms. The Bootcamp gave me an initial start for learning Computer Programming. I did some freelancing projects to practice my Web Development Skills.
          Another Bootcamp I attended was LINUX WORLD in Jaipur where I learned the Basics of Linux, Big Data, and Red Hat. I worked as a Research Intern and got a Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) Certificate with a 100% score. After my second year, I went to Codeasylum Bangalore as a Mentor and Student and taught Python and Big Data Fundamentals and learned Machine Learning and Data Science. I stood Second in Hack in The North, a hackathon organized by IIIT Allahabad. I won a Special Mention Award for Blockchain Technology.My participation in hackathons and Talks about various technologies got me some internship offers.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>3. What Message would you give to the first and second Year undergraduates on effectively using their Time and maintaining their social as well as Academic life?</strong>
          <br>
          => College life is all about interacting with other students and building connections but keeping a stronghold on our academics is also important. Excelling in one anyone with zero holds on the other is of no use. First Year of the College is all About Exploring. It is best to use your first year in building Connections and making friends because you have less academic pressure and so the best time to build your social life is your first year. Along with this, you attend different workshops to explore different fields and find your interest. For the second year, you should focus on your technical skills and constantly work on improving them. Be it Web Development or Machine learning or any other Technical field only constant practice and dedication can help you in excelling in the particular field. Always focus on your interests and also try and engage in different activities like sports, painting, filming, and photography.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>4.How did you discover that “this particular sector“ is suitable for me or i have interest in this? How did You carry forward in this?</strong>
          <br>
          => In the Summer Break after my first year, I had attended a programming Bootcamp at Codeasylum Pune where I learned Web Development and Basics of Data Structure and Algorithms. I was the only first Year Student and all the others were from the 2nd or 3rd year. My good performance in the Bootcamp gave me the confidence to Pursue Software Engineering and learn about different technologies and frameworks. My interest to gain and learn development skills made it easy for me to constantly work and learn about Web Development, Data Science, Big Data, Linux, and Machine learning. to carry forward it’s important to work on projects. Projects will help you practicing and implementing your knowledge as in my case I did some freelancing projects to practice Web Development.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>5.What are the Technical Skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
          <br>
          => My job is based on Software Profile so I don’t have a strong focus on all the Core subjects but as a EEE graduate, you should be familiar with the basics of your course subjects. Most of the companies for Electrical graduates also ask about some Electronics subjects like VLSI and Verilog. Machines are also another Subject where you should have a stronghold. For these Subjects, it’s important to have a stronghold on the theory.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>6.How early should one Start preparing for internships and how important an internship? Where did you pursue your Internship?</strong>
          <br>
          => It is never too late to start but it’s better to start planning and preparing for your internship from your first year. Even if you start 6 months before it’s fine. As early as you start, you have more time to enhance your skills. Internships help you learn and work in a team. Most of the Companies give you a PPO if you perform well in an internship and so it is easier to get a placement offer via internship than the placements in your Fourth Year. Competitive Programming and Projects are most important for getting an internship. Also, one should focus on some core computer science subjects like Computer Networking, Operating systems, and DBMS. I did not get an On-campus internship in my third year so I worked at Codeasylum Bangalore as a Mentor.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>7.What are the Projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
          => Projects are really important for getting any internship and placement. One should make projects about which he can discuss in your interviews. The major part and discussions in the interviews are only about the projects and implementation and its Future Scope. It is the most evident thing which can prove your intent and passion. Unique ideas and features give you an edge over other students. One of my major projects was on a Distributed System. I made a Decentralized Cloud System where the unused part of our memory can be used for rent. Also for the transaction of the rent, I created my coin like Bitcoin using Blockchain Technology. In most of my interviews, my discussion revolved around this project.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>8.What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
          => There were 5 rounds including 1 Online Coding Test and 4 Personal interviews. The first round includes some coding questions and some objective questions on OS, DBMS and OOP’s. The second round was an interview where they asked about Core CSE subjects like OS, DBMS, OOPS, Computer Networking and Compiler and this round went for 1 and half hour. The third round was again an interview where I was asked to solve 2 coding questions and a few questions about core subjects. The fourth round was a Hiring Manager Round. This round included some basic discussion about the work culture and also, I was asked some puzzles and some Competitive programming questions. My Projects were discussed in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th round. The last round was HR round. The whole interview process went for 2 days.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>9.What was the toughest part while preparing for the Interviews?</strong>
          <br>
          => I never liked solving Competitive Programming questions as CP questions have no relevance to the work, we need to do inside a software company. I was always good at Development and making projects.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>10.Tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of the college?</strong>
          <br>
          => The portal has all the information about which and when the company will start the On-campus recruitment. When any company arrives for recruitment the interested students upload their resumes. The Portal and the Training and Placement Cell are of great help for students while Placements.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>11.How to choose and apply for internships so that we can make our way in the right company that we want to join?</strong>
          <br>
          => You apply for both On-campus and Off-campus internships. Internships are of great help and are your first work experience so while applying you must search for your preferred role and should match your interest. Don’t just apply to every other company just because everyone else is applying because this can also get you an internship that you don’t want. Have patience and look for your interest.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>12.What are your future plans? Would you like to go for Higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
          => I am not much sure about going for higher studies. I am currently looking for some sort of specialization in some particular field of Data Science and Data Engineering. I have no plans for MS or M.Tech. I will continue my job for some years and then plan for higher studies.`,

          >> I have been placed in Walmart Labs for the Software Development Engineer-2 role and I also got a PPO from Games 24x7 for the Software Development Engineer role after my Summer intern.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you a part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I was a part of the EEESoc, NSS, Rotaract club in my 1st and 2nd year and in my final year, I joined ACM. These clubs played a significant role for me and helped me to learn teamwork. Also, I got to interact with a lot of seniors who were very helpful. One of the major reasons to join a lot of clubs is to explore what kind of things you really want to do in future.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What message would you give to the first-year and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I would advise my juniors to keep at least 7.5 CGPA because when I was in my 3rd year, I was having 7.02 CGPA so I was not able to sit for most of the companies which came on campus like Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Samsung, etc and in the companies in which I was interviewed, I was always in disadvantage. But, if let’s say one does not have a good CGPA then they can always go for off-campus Internships as I did. The process is a little bit tedious but if you are passionate about software development or whichever field you’re going for then you will eventually get good results.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I think one should start preparing for internships from the 2nd year. Some of my friends did not do any internship, still they also got placed. So internships are not necessary but I would say that doing internships will give you an edge over others. I could not grab an on-campus internship in my third year. So, I did development in the end and tried for off-campus internships and eventually got SDE (Backend) Intern at Games24x7.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Which platform did you use for applying to an off-campus internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >>I applied to many companies through LinkedIn but did not get calls from most of them. I did get calls from some of the start-ups. I did not apply from the career pages, I just sent the request to the HRs and the talent acquisition team and I also cold emailed them like what is my experience, what projects I have done and what will I bring to the table if I join the company. I got 3 offers from early-stage startups as an SDE intern before getting an offer from Games24x7.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. You have an extensive Competitive Programming background. So, what do’s/don’ts you would like to give for becoming a good Competitive Programmer? Which topics are the focus areas of DSA?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> So, for competitive programming, I started doing it seriously from the mid of the 4th semester when lockdown happened. I participated in contests on Codeforces, Codechef and sometimes on AtCoder also. After contests, I used to discuss solutions with my friends and I used to solve the questions which I was not able to solve during the live contest. So, I would suggest up solving the problem is a must, if you want to do well in CP. Also one can try out the feature of the virtual contest if he/she misses any contest.
          <br>
          I also followed some YouTube channels like Kartik Arora, Aditya Verma, Utkarsh Gupta, Striver, CodeNCode for understanding DSA & CP topics. Many people face problems in Solving DP so I would suggest working on recursion and doing more problems. After doing a number of problems, you will start seeing the patterns. I would also suggest not just binge watch videos, one should first try the problem on his/her own then watch the solution and then you will realise that what you were doing wrong. Also, I solved the Strivers list and some Interview Bit questions when I was preparing for Internships.
          
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I did an externship program called CRIO winter of doing which had three stages. A total of 10,000+ developers took part in that program. I wanted to make good use of that opportunity to enhance my skills as a Developer.
          <br>
          I worked on two projects in that program; one was a full-stack project (XMeme) where anyone can post any meme. After that, I worked on the backend of a project which was to build a Credit Card Management System like Cred. It was assigned to us by CRED during the third stage of the program. It was a team project where I worked on the backend and one of my friends who also got selected worked on the Frontend of the project. We were the winning team from our Project.


          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> There were four rounds for Walmart comprising of one online coding round and three interviews. In my first interview, I was asked to code a problem on string manipulation which was an Easy level problem, after that, I was asked questions from OOP and basic React, I was also asked questions from OS and DBMS. After the first round, I was selected for the second round where I was asked two DSA questions one on Binary Trees and another on Strings both were Leetcode Medium Level problems. I was also asked some questions on DBMS and OS. I was also asked questions about the work I had done at Games 24x7. In the last round (i.e., HR round) I was asked about my projects, SQL queries and behavioural questions.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How did you prepare for topics like OS, DBMS, System Design and Computer networking?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> For OS and DBMS, I referred to a course from GFG. For HLD, I watched videos of Gaurav Sen. I didn’t extensively prepare for Networking only referred to GFG last-minute notes before interviews. 
          <br>

          I used to read interview questions of OS, DBMS and System Design from Interviewbit and JavaTPoint before any interview. It also helped.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I am quite satisfied with this SDE job right now but I may go for masters in distributed systems after three-four years of job.

        interview: `<strong>Q. Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong>
          <br>
          >> I have been placed in Paytm as a software engineer.
          <br>

          <strong>Q. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you a part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Even with the campus life reduced to half due to covid, college life lived up to its billing of being fun and exciting. I have had some great time hanging out with my friends. Probably the most rewarding times in college have been the countless hours spent playing different sports. I have been a member of IEEE since first year. Being in IEEE provided invaluable guidance and exposure to coding among other things. I have also been a member of IETE and it has been really helpful in learning and experimenting with practical aspects of electrical and electronics engineering.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What message would you give to the first-year and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> During the first couple years of college, it’s much simpler to maintain decent academics while exploring your interests and doing more things you enjoy. You can spend quite some time hanging out with friends and have fun while maintaining a decent CGPA without fussing over it a lot.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> For me it was rather straightforward that I enjoyed coding much more than the core subjects. Discovering your “suitable sector” really just comes down to enjoying studying and knowing more about that particular subject. I mostly started seriously working on it halfway through my second year, although in hindsight it would have been better to have started a little earlier.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Many of the students have interest in both core and software, what would you suggest them?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> As long as it interests you to pursue both the fields, it is worth it to keep learning both core and software. Quite a lot of avenues in technical field require some knowledge of both these fields. Learning never hurts but when it comes down to it, you should know to prioritize one over the other depending on your own interests and goals.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Besides having a decent knowledge about the subjects in the college curriculum, it really depends on your individual interests. You could choose to explore more in the field of electronics or electrical (VLSI, PCB designing, PLC, ARDUINO, etc.) Or choose to develop skills in coding where the choices are frankly endless.
          
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I am not a big proponent of preparing for internships just for the sake of it. Explore as much as you can in the earlier stages of your college life, and once you have identified what interests you, just keep learning and improving your skills. However, it does help to do some targeted preparation for a few months before the companies start visiting the campus. Internships are important in providing you with some invaluable learning and industry experience and possibly add some more value to your resume. However, having pursued an internship or otherwise should not really matter much when it comes to placements as long as you have the skills and can communicate it to your interviewer. I interned with Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore.
 
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I created a website for a library with resources collaborated and maintained by the students. I also worked on an ML project to automate toll booths with image processing and create a website to provide a platform to automate toll payments. Working on projects is probably the best way to learn and hone your skills. In the context of placements and internships, explaining your projects to your interviewer can be a great metric for them to gauge your understanding and if you can do it well, it is a great way to communicate your skills to the interviewer.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The selection procedure for Paytm involved an online coding round (3 coding questions-intermediate level) followed by two technical interviews. The interviews mainly focused on understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms and basic topics of computer science like Computer Networking, DBMS, OS, Object Oriented Programming, etc. besides some general questions and some questions about the projects and internship experiences.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Currently my plans are to start with my training and job while improving on my skills. I haven’t given much thought to pursuing higher studies as of yet and it will depend on how it factors into my career goals in a few years.

          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Q. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> One advice I would give to someone pursuing coding is instead of shifting focus from a fancy technology to another; focus on getting your basics right first.
          
          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Q. If you are from software sector, how did you balance between coding and electrical studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> It is simpler to balance them in the initial couple of years as the college curriculum is not very demanding and then it takes some effort to take out time for coding. Online classes surely helped!

          <br>
          >> I am placed at Goldman Sachs. The role is that of a Software Development Engineer (SDE) and is referred to as a ‘Technology Analyst’ in the firm.

          <br>
          The role involves combining the best open-source software, databases, cloud solutions, and programming languages, to solve problems and provide accurate, complex, scalable applications that will help the business and clients of the firm gain new insights.

          <strong>Q. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you a part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I was a part of various clubs and societies (both tech and non-tech) & even held leadership positions in a few of them. The clubs have helped me immensely, not only in terms of the number of people I interacted with, who eventually ended up being great friends but also in enhancing my persona.
          <br>
          I was actively involved in the co-curricular activities at our campus, ranging from hosting events, participating in many of them, to being a part of the organization team of all our annual fests (thankfully it wasn’t online back then;) I genuinely believe that the aforementioned things have added a lot of value in shaping my personality and are some of the best memories of my college days.

          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What message would you give to the first and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Identifying the right balance for oneself is of utmost importance. Time management isn’t one-size-fits-all, hence, we should try to find a system that aligns with our priorities and end goals. I’d suggest students explore different clubs & events and figure out what interests them the most. It is said that these are the best years of one’s life, so do try to make the most of it, both in terms of enjoyment, as well as your overall development. Focus on enhancing your skill-set because it pays off remarkably, however, do not completely neglect your academics.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or do I have an interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I used to do programming on and off earlier, however, the pandemic & the induced lockdown confined us within our home, that is when I started coding regularly. I enjoyed doing web development and had built quite a few projects during that time. I eventually discovered that I’m more fascinated in this field compared to the other alternatives, and with the guidance of seniors & of course Google/YouTube, I gradually navigated through this.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Many of the students have an interest in both core and software, what would you suggest to them?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Try to explore both the fields initially, for instance, maybe try to do a mini-project, this will help you figure out what interests you more. Then you should eventually decide what sector you want to pursue.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> There’s no pre-defined list per se. For placements, it entirely depends on the field you are going forward with, for example, if you wish to be a Software Developer, some of the desired skills would be: good problem-solving, a strong understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms, and knowledge of fundamentals of computer science. Similarly, it will be different for other domains.
          
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The sooner the better. An internship is a great learning experience, especially because it gives first-hand exposure to the corporate world and real-life projects. I interned as a Summer Analyst at Goldman Sachs itself.
 
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> A few notable ones would be Speech Recognition using MATLAB; developing Concord: a real-time chat app built with socket.io, node & express; and finding the best pilot positions for channel estimation using deep learning.
          <br>
          They helped a lot in my interview, as one of the interviewers was very interested in my speech recognition project and asked a lot of questions, and we discussed at length the scope of this project.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Be consistent with coding. Have a strong understanding of the basics and try to do at least 1–2 projects pertaining to any domain of your choice.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. If you are from the software sector, how did you balance between coding and electrical studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> There isn’t any fixed formula that I followed. I paid attention to the lectures taught in the class and revised it periodically, this gave me enough understanding of my course subjects.
          <br>
          I tried to be as much consistent as I can with coding, giving contests was a crucial part of this.

          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Q. How did you prepare for the interviews? What was the toughest part for you while giving the interviews?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I researched thoroughly about the company and the job requirements. I also went through interview experiences of people who have made it through and brushed up DSA, DBMS, OOPs, and OS.
          <br>
          The toughest part for me was to explain to the interviewer why I, being an Electrical Engineering undergrad should be selected, instead of someone from CSE/IT branch. Thankfully I managed to convince him with my response to this question.
          
          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Q. If an aspiring student wasn’t able to secure an on-campus internship, what recommendation do you have for that person both academically (off-campus/ research internship) and mentally.</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Try looking for opportunities via LinkedIn, or other platforms like D2C, etc. Do not panic because it’s not the end of the world. If not an internship, you may go for a research project on any domain which interests you. There are global research internship opportunities too like Mitacs, try to search about these as much as you can.
          
          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Q. Is it necessary to have internships for good placement? Any alternative?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Internships do give an edge during placement interviews, having said that, it won’t be very damaging even if you don’t have one, given that you’ve enhanced your skill-set, and can substantially show that to the recruiters.

        interview: `<strong>Q. Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong>
          <br>
          >> I got an internship at Wells Fargo in my third year and the job description was something related to software engineering intern. That basically involved working on a full-scale software development life cycle. I secured a PPO from them but after several off-campus interviews; I got FTE offers from Xiaomi and Microsoft as well.
          <br>
          I also gave interviews for companies like Google, Facebook, Bloomberg, Intuit, Cred and Uber.

          <strong>Q. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you a part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> What I heard in the first year was that if you are not in a club, you won’t get a placement. I was very much affected by that myth. I tried applying to all the clubs, but I was not selected in any of the clubs in my first year. It was very disappointing and I was very much disheartened.
          <br>
          I was a member of EEESoc. It was very helpful. The seniors assisted me with a lot of extracurricular work which helped me to grow personally and professionally.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What message would you give to the first and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I would point out correctly if someone wants to pursue software development, then he should have a crystal-clear idea that Competitive Programming (CP) is actually important. My suggestions would be to use time squeezing strategies like don’t rest a single moment. If you have free time and if your mood is correct, then don’t waste your time roaming here and there and doing nothing. Just open your phone and try to solve the problems.
          <br>
          Also, don’t get too stressed. Take breaks. When I used to get stressed, I would watch anime and then again return to CP. Basically, keep a balanced life but give a lot of focus on CP.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. You have an extensive background in computer programming, so what are the dos and don’ts you would like to share?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Take it as a sport, like you’re playing chess or badminton or whatever, don’t take it too seriously. Don’t stick to the failures for a long time and don’t stick to your wins also for a long time, because both of them are pretty dangerous. If you stick with your failures for a long time, you may end up self-berating, and it will ultimately affect your problem-solving. It will not help you in your growth at all and if you stick too much with your success like, let’s say, you achieve three-star, and all your friends are struggling; you might become vain. So don’t restrict yourself to a limit, I would suggest being limitless.

          <strong>Q. What are the projects you have done in four years and how did they help you with your placement?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I didn’t do a lot of projects, one project that I did was during the SPP by EEESoc. It was a basic project. However, the application was very innovative. I just used that project on my resume. There was another project on the database, but it was very ridiculous. It could only fetch me negative points, which I learned later. So, I removed it. Basically you should know that whatever project you do, don’t plagiarise and keep it deep. Like when you are asked any questions about it you are able to answer them.

          <strong>Q. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is, and also what if you don’t get an internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Okay, so there’s never a right time for a start. Like whenever you have made up your mind that is it. You should not waste any more time thinking about different stuffs. Worrying about and asking ten different people won’t solve your issue. I will only be talking about software sector. You can just start preparing from YouTube; it will be very much helpful. There are a lot of resources. If you have time, then you can also prepare for computer core subjects like DBMS, OS, and computer networks. Interviewers are mostly looking for problem-solving skills.
          <br>
          If you did not do an internship, you will get lots of free time and during those two months, you can manage your time to do college coursework preparation and placement preparation.
          <br>
          One thing you can do is practice more interviews with your friends because that’s the most realistic thing. So, try to do as much more interviews. Ask seniors to take your interview. I remember being helped by EEESoc seniors for the interview prep.

          <strong>Q. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> It had three rounds: the first round was debugging which was easy, the second round was coding, and they gave seventy minutes for two questions. The first question was based on trees. I had an adequate practice of trees and I was able to solve it. The second question was a very weirdly difficult question, which I assume was from dynamic programming. The third round was an IQ based round.
          <br>
          The interview was totally technical, like DBMS, some graphs questions, OS, etc.

          <strong>Q. What are your future plans and would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> My future plans are to try and explore the software industry a little bit more like trying to see all the life cycles of a project. Right from how big tech companies try to understand the requirements of the customers, how they come up with new products, how they sell it and earn profits. I want to be a part of all this process, and definitely higher studies are always a quite attractive option for me.
