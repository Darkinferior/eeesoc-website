        interview: `<strong>1.In which company have you been placed and what is the job profile?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I have been offered 6 month intern and full time employment at
          Box8,
          Mumbai. I was recruited in the business analyst profile. I am
          supposed
          to work with data to derive the insights with the help of which the
          company would run.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>2.Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were
          you
          part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did
          they helped you through your college life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> My college life was really brilliant and I made really good
          friends.
          To begin with I was in number of clubs like NAPS and IETE and one
          society EEESoc. In later stages I left a couple of them to focus on
          my
          interview process. However, importance of clubs can’t be neglected
          in my
          case as they helped me to build a strong foundation, they helped me
          to
          improve my communication skills.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>3.How did you manage your academic and social life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> So this is the question which is present in the mind of every
          student. However to achieve a balance between social life and
          academics,
          the person requires to work hard and manage time with slight
          dedication.
          I maintained quite good balance between them.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>4.How important are the internships and where did you did your
          internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> In my third year I got my internship in PriceWaterhouse Coopers
          at
          Bangalore. Internship is very important as it gives exposure to
          cooperate life and help to improve your team management skills. It
          will
          be one of the points in your resume but at the same time it's not
          that
          much vital part like if a student is not doing an internship then
          also
          he can get placement as he can prepare well for placement while
          others
          are doing internships.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>5.What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they
          helped
          in your placement?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I did two projects with EEESoc ,one work during my Internship at
          PWC
          and one on web development in code asylum.One of the project with
          EEESoc
          was speaker recognition using MATLAB. At PWC I did a project on CRM
          System i.e. Customer Relationship Management System and Web
          development
          project was about building a E-Portal.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>6.Tell us about your interview process and what difficulties you
          faced?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Actually Box8 interview process was a rigorous one. First stage
          was
          an online one that followed two technical interviews and one HR
          interaction. The online test comprised of question of basic
          aptitude,LR
          and DI, then the short listed students were called for Tech
          interview
          round 1.there were 2 Tech interview rounds. So in both the round
          they
          asked similar questions. They were related to the projects we did
          during
          4 years and they also gave us some case study problems and
          estimates.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>7.What are the technical skills pre-requisite for a EEE student?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> One should be familiar with both software and hardware. Students
          interested in core should have sound knowledge of machines, power
          systems and power electronics and also have a good knowledge of
          MATLAB.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>8.Any advice for students who wish to get into consultancy firms?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The first and foremost requirement is that students should be
          able to
          present themselves with utmost confidence. They should have good
          communication skills as well as good aptitude skills.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>9.Were there any out of the box questions?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> In the second interview round, I was asked to analyze the
          performance
          of a newly launched product and suggest ideas which should be
          incorporated.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>10.Apart from a decent GPA, what according to you are the skills
          which
          should be possessed by a student?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> If a student is interested in Software Company, he/she should be
          good
          at competitive coding. For consultancy, aptitude and communication
          skills should be excellent as mentioned before, while for core
          companies
          like Tata Steel, ample amount of knowledge of machines and power
          system
          is required.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>11.What are you future plans?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I really wish to work on developing my skillsets as of now,
          however I
          have plans to pursue MS or MBA in the long run.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>12.Any college related advice to your juniors?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Stay focused, have confidence, believe in yourself, enjoy your
          college days but nevertheless do not get diverted from you goal.
          Patience and hard work will always pay off. Try to maintain a CGPA
          between 7.5 to 8.5. Else there might be some difficulty.`,

        interview: `<strong>Q: Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job
          description?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I got two offers. Firstly, I was an intern at
          PricewaterhouseCoopers for the position of technology associate.
          After the internship it got converted to a pre-placement offer,
          which I declined because I was selected for the role of decision
          analytics associate for ZS Associates, which is basically a company
          that deals in the pharmaceutical sector, via ZS campus beats.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were
          you the part of any club or society throughout your college life and
          how did they help you through your college life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> When I joined college, like everyone else, I was disappointed to
          join B.I.T. Mesra but I was resolute that I won’t take a drop, so I
          came to this college. I was also very sceptical about my branch
          being Electrical and Electronics. Upon joining college, I had one
          aim, to not let go of anything good and gain experience
          holistically. I paid equal heed to the college studies as well as
          the extracurricular activities that were happening in the college.
          This was one of the reasons why I had joined multiple clubs. Coming
          to college I joined I.E.T.E B.I.T Mesra, following which I joined
          Firebolt Racing, after which I was a member of both Rororact and Leo
          clubs. I’m also a member of S.A.E B.I.T Mesra as well as UNESQUO. I
          kept myself engaged in the different events that happened in the
          college and I believe that helped me build my personality. If you
          take a piece of what Vivek Gupta is today, it will contain equal
          proportions of all the clubs that I have been a part of, all the
          events I have helped organize, the various competitions that I have
          participated in along with a little bit of the branch that I hail
          from. So, what I feel is college life should be a mix of everything.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: How did you manage your academic and social life ?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Like I said that I was the only one in the batch who was a member
          of so many clubs in the college, even I questioned myself if I would
          become an important part of any of them. I did not wish to join
          clubs just for the sake of it. I saw to it that whenever I was
          engaged in an activity I completed it successfully. I used to have a
          club meeting almost everyday. I’d complete my classes, sort out the
          work given in the clubs and the head back, in time for dinner. This
          was how most of my first, second as well as third year passed.
          Because of this, I now have some of my seniors as my best friends
          and also a very good connection with my juniors because of these
          activities. So, managing such a number of clubs is easy if you enjoy
          it. I didn’t go back to watch sitcoms or spend hours on games, so I
          managed the clubs very well.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: What are the technical skills that are important for EEE
          graduates?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> When it comes to placements, what I’ve seen is that a company
          looks for very specific skills. Say a company is of core
          electronics, it will look for subjects related to it. If I have to
          sum up the skills which everyone should know, I’d say it is the will
          to learn, because if you know little basics of electrical or
          electronics that is taught in the beginning it will be enough to
          pick up the subjects you wish to learn. I have friends placed in
          core electronic subjects who just started 5 months ago from scratch.
          So you basically need to be open to learning.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: How important are internships and where did you do your
          internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> When an engineering student comes to college, they’re confused as
          to what to do. With the freedom that’s provided in the college they
          tend to go in multiple directions and end up not becoming aware of
          how their corporate lives will be. The one thing that helps steer
          away from this confusion is Internships. So the strange thing about
          me is that I’m from Ranchi, and the college as well is in Ranchi.
          However, I’ve never been home in any of my vacations. Even after the
          end of the first semester. I’ve interned at Rockwell automation,
          where I specialised in PLC. I interned in E Ride where my position
          was of a digital market strategist. I also interned at Andritz hydro
          at Bhopal which gave knowledge of core electronics as there I was
          seeing the manufacture of real hydro electrical power components.
          Initially I also interned at JSPL. Finally I ended up at
          PricewaterhouseCoopers from the campus selection internship. I did
          these internships to know what I’ll be at the end of these four
          years, because when you know what the end point is, you can form a
          path to reach it. Being from electrical, I took up internship at
          Andritz hyo which made me realize this is something I don’t want to
          do in future. I took internships in every field so as to develop my
          interest and decide which one of them I’m best suited for.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they
          help in your placement?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Surprisingly for a EEE student, I didn’t do a project of my own.
          I did multiple projects under the clubs I was in such as one under
          Firebolt Racing, based on polymers that can be used for the body
          panels. The major project that I got to do was during my internship
          at PWC. They asked me to do developing and I had to code, which I
          had never done much in my life. I developed a facial recognition
          system for point of sale. I’m sure projects are quite helpful as
          they give you an edge over the other students, but frankly speaking,
          I didn’t do any of them and it all turned out well in the end.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: Tells us about your interview process and what are the
          difficulties you faced in the process?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> As I got two offers, I will start with the first one. I was
          selected for internship at PWC for which there were three round.
          First was an online aptitude test, consisting of questions from LR,
          DI, Quantitative and English.It was a one hour test and there were
          45 questions. The second and the third rounds were personal
          interviews, with the first being a technical while the second
          interview was more of a HR interview. To prepare I took a few
          practice online tests from the vendors who provide for the company’s
          tests. For the interviews, I don’t think that anything can be done
          at the last moment. I’ve bagged opportunities based more on my
          personality than my technical knowledge. First of all, you need to
          be confident. You need to present yourself well so as to impress the
          interviewer. You basically need to play the interviewer and bring
          him to a topic which you’re well versed in. The third round was a HR
          interview which was quite simple.
          The second placement that I got was at ZS associates. ZS holds an
          off-campus competition known as ZS campus beats for the students of
          third year, wherein the students have to submit themselves for a
          case study. The case is presented to them and they need to solve it
          within 24hrs. and submit it in the form of a presentation. The top
          three across the country are selected and called to their head
          office in Pune where they undergo a day-long workshop after which
          they explain their presentation to the jury members. For that you
          need to be very good in analytical and presentation skills. I was
          offered a pre-placement interview offer from ZS via this
          competition. For this there were three rounds. The first was a tech
          and puzzle solving round. The second was a behavioural round where
          the company checks whether you’re fit for the job that you’re
          applying for and had questions such as guesstimates which can be
          practiced from Youtube. The final round was with a director, with
          questions similar to the first two and basic HR questions.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: What are your advice for the students who have an interest in
          coding but are in EEE and also how should they apply for companies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I think me answering this question would be very apt. I rejected
          the offer of CSE in one college and came for EEE in BIT Mesra. I
          thought I would pick up coding here but studying the placement stats
          of previous years I decided not to do it. But I do have some friends
          who took up coding and worked on it through the years and their hard
          work eventually paid off. Nowadays students of EEE are not just
          restricted to their branch companies. With modernization a lot of
          companies have begun to allow EEE students to sit for their offers.
          Also every company hires off-campus and almost everyone who took up
          coding is placed in a company of his or her choice. My suggestion to
          someone who likes coding would be to make some good friends in CSE
          and IT match your skills with them, and I’m sure the hard work will
          pay off.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: Any out of the box question was asked in Interview round and HR
          round? Does vocational training help in grabbing good placements?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I would like to talk about my interview with
          PricewaterhouseCoopers. It was strange in a manner that I was
          carrying three folders, each one full of certificates, one laptop
          with a presentation about myself and my resume. Seeing that, the
          interviewer was quite impressed. He just asked me two questions, why
          I wished to join PWC and to tell him something about myself. That
          was it. Now when I look back at it, I think the companies wish to
          look more at what you’ve done in your college years than ask
          questions, as that defines the person you are. The second interview
          was with ZS associates. I was given a puzzle, which I kept trying to
          solve and each time ended on a solution that the interviewer said
          was wrong and to try again. Luckily, the entire interview went quite
          well except for that one question. It was there I learnt that if you
          explain what’s going through your mind, the interviewer will
          understand it. And when you get an out of the box question, you need
          to think from the perspective of the interviewer. You need to stay
          calm, composed and you’ll find the solution to any out of the box
          questions that may be asked.
          I did not sit for many companies. PWC was the first company I sat
          for and I got the offer. When it was converted to PPO I was not able
          to sit from the campus because I got an offer from ZS Associates. So
          this is one experience that I lack. I’ve never realized the pressure
          of campus placements as I’ve never really been through that phase. I
          kept taking opportunities as they came my way and in the end it
          turned out to be good for me. Your preparation should be company
          specific. If you’re going for a company, try to know what’s the next
          thing that they’re working on. This puts a good impression on the
          interviewer and may even startle them as to how you know about their
          projects.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: Were you asked any subject related questions in the interview?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> My profile is such that it does not deal with any subject in
          particular, because technological associate was more related to
          management and coding to some extent and it did not ask me any
          questions related to my subjects. Even the role offered to me by ZS
          associates didn’t require much from any of my subjects. I think that
          in Engineering, you may not require everything that you learn in
          class, but how you learn it or crack it is something that turns out
          to be more helpful.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: Apart from a decent CGPA what other skills do you think are the
          most sought after by the companies in the students while recruiting?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The placement process of companies has been tuned in a way to get
          an ideal candidate, not just in terms of academics but also as an
          individual who may be able to represent the company. To sum up the
          attributes required by the companies in their candidates, the first
          would be communication skills. Second is obviously the technical
          knowledge. The third and the most important skill would be
          confidence. To be able to spin around the question in a way as to
          avoid a simple “I don’t know” is something that the companies look
          for. Your personality, resume, activities and hobbies, and what you
          can derive from them in your interview matters the most.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: What was it like to study in your major (core or software)?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The only thing I couldn’t do in my college years was to
          understand my core subjects. I tried but not too hard. For me,
          personally, I didn’t need to study much to maintain a decent gpa.
          Last night studies were enough for me to maintain gpa of 8.05. I
          used to run away from the core subjects. I’m sure studying the core
          subjects gets a person to a good place but that wasn’t the place for
          me and so, I focused more on what I felt would be beneficial in
          getting me where I wished to be.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q: What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher
          studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I wish to pursue management so I have planned to do MBA in
          future. I’m also looking for a Masters in Management programme
          outside India. I thought I’d join a company for two years, gain some
          work experience, and the go for something that interests me. I’m
          open to things that happen in life and wish to make the most of
          every opportunity that I get. I like to do things as they come, and
          this is good in a way that it doesn’t get one too worked up. I
          haven’t thought that seriously about my future but would certainly
          like to pursue MBA.

          <strong>Q: What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the
          field you’ve chosen?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I’ll tell you an interesting story. A friend of mine was
          interning at Tata steel. In the first week of his internship, he
          told me that people from McKinsey were working there on the same
          project as him. That shocked me a lot. So, a person who has studied
          electrical was working for the same project which people from
          McKinsey which is one of the world’s largest consultancies, were
          working for. There’s no way of expressing how widespread consultancy
          is because everything that you do requires proper project planning,
          execution, handling of different software etc. and all this is done
          by a consultant. I don’t think that consultancy is all about making
          presentations and talking to people. It’s about planning and
          projecting. India is on a boom for consultancies with so many
          companies coming up with offices for the same. Also, consultancies
          have taken up most of the projects set up by the government instead
          of the navratna companies. There is a lot of technical work that’s
          involved in consultancies. My position requires use of R, Python,
          SAS. These are all core coding concepts and I think consultancy is
          the link that joins all the various fields of engineering together.
          My advice to the juniors would be to keep yourself engaged. Don’t
          run from things because they give you stress or to have more time
          for yourself. You need to do as much as you can because everything
          ultimately contributes to your future. One should join as many clubs
          of their interests as they can because they, personally, helped me a
          lot. Firebolt racing had a huge impact in my placements and also the
          kind of person that I am. UNESQUO was a club that helped me nurture
          my skills of quiz and debate. So keep yourself engaged. The world is
          filled with opportunities and college is the only place where you’ll
          get this sort of time and freedom to explore these opportunities.
          Always try to better today than what you were the day before. And of
          course, have fun!`,

        company: "BNY MELLON AND ORACLE",
        interview: `<strong>1. Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong><br>
          >> I got an Intern and FullTime offer as a Software Developer, from Bank of New York Mellon. The job location being Pune or Chennai. I have also received an offer from Oracle as an associate consultant for both Intern and Fte.<br><br>
  
          <strong>2. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you a part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong><br>
          >>I really enjoyed my college life. Traveling around Ranchi, trying out every restaurant with my friends on weekends, and thank god for that because I believe K17 batch is the unluckiest of all. Out of 4 years of engineering, we could only enjoy 2.5 years of it. Talking about clubs, I was in dance club, Rotaract and Literary society. However, I left all clubs other than the dance one, since I really liked to dance, to focus more on my studies and to manage time for some serious coding. I was always the person who did all the work only when the deadline was close or if someone really pushed me to do so, but then the years in college has made me overall an organized person and more workaholic than I ever was. I would say enjoy the course of your time in college because these four years of experience and fun will transform you into a mature person for sure in a good way :D.<br><br>
  
          <strong>3. What message would you give to the first and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong><br>
          >>I would encourage first and second-year undergrads to really enjoy all the fests and be in the clubs of their choice because being social is an important aspect of being a good employee who knows how to communicate his thoughts. I personally started coding very late, mid of my 5th semester. So I would not tell you to neglect your studies. Take out time every week to improve on your academic skills, it will help you in getting internships and give you a mental time to be ready to face your dream companies. Being early to the race is always better than being in the line at the last minute(I was the one who came in last-minute however would not suggest you follow me on this one :p).<br><br>
          
          <strong>4. Can we apply for other companies also, when already placed in one?</strong><br>
          >>See there are different categories of type in our college:
          Type 1- Companies in this type (like Infosys) are mass recruiters and if you get placed in this category you cannot sit in type 1 again but can sit in type 2 and dream companies.
          Type 2- If you get placed in this category you can only sit again in dream companies afterwards . There are a lot of companies that come in this category.
          Type 3(Dream)- Companies include Microsoft etc, if you get placed in this you won’t be able to sit in any other companies on-campus.
          Apart from this, you can apply off-campus through Linkedin and there are a lot of other job portals like glassdoor.<br><br>
          
          <strong>5. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong><br>
          >>I guess for EEE students, focus on core subjects maintain a gpa of atleast 7 because Tata Steel is the only company that comes for internship in 3rd year. Other than that for FTE Intel, Addverb, Infineon and some other companies offer special roles for core eee students.<br><br>
          
          <strong>6. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong><br>
          >> Explore your options and take time to choose and do all of these in your 1st year. Once you are in your 2nd year, start working towards your goal, since companies like Microsoft and Goldman Sachs start coming to college at the start of 3rd year. I would not say that internships are that important, but it sure looks good in your resume and will give you some brownie points in a job interview. I personally didn’t attend any interviews for internships except 2 companies, because as I said, I just started with coding in my third year. I did an internship off-campus in a small startup to gain some actual industry-level skills as it would not hurt to gain a little experience side-by-side.<br><br>
          
          <strong>7. How to choose and apply for internships, so that we can make our way in the right company that we want to join?</strong><br>
          >> Firstly, I would suggest you make an online presence on Linkedin, Freelancer.com, and internshala, they have a lot of opportunities for you guys. Keep the alerts on only for the companies of your choice so that you only get the important notifications. I would also suggest you go to the jobs page of companies through Linkedin and apply from there so that you don’t miss the deadlines.<br><br>
          
          <strong>8. What was the selection procedure for your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong><br>
          >>Talking about BNY Mellon I had a total of 5 rounds, First one was the Code Divas Online test of 4hrs with 4 questions, in which 10 people including me had bagged consolation prizes. The second round was a tech round in which one of the questions was to reverse a linked list using stack and there were 2 more questions which I don’t remember, I was also asked a lot about OOP’s and my personal internships and projects. The third round was a code kata round which was a java specific round, in which we were needed to extract the data from a class which was not very hard if you know basic oops concept. The fourth round was also a tech round in which one question was to find the intersection node in a loop formed by two linked lists, then one question was similar to balanced parenthesis in an array of strings and maximum replacements we could do to make it balanced and the last question was to return an array as sorted array in which we needed to remove each string which was an anagram of the earlier string from a given array of strings. The last round was a bar raiser round with normal HR questions, basically, it was just a discussion to find out about my future interests and knowing me personally as a person. About Oracle it was similar, 1 coding test comprising mixed oops, DBMS, java questions. 2nd round was a tech round similar to BNY but a little less technical because role was of an associate consultant. The last round was tech+hr with normal questions on projects and internship experiences and future expectations and all of that.<br><br>
          
          <strong>9. How important is Competitive Programming/Problem Solving skills in interviews for decent IT companies? Do Interviewers seek for developer skills or want DSA knowledge?</strong><br>
          >>It is very important for all the coding companies even for mass recruiters like Infosys. You should have sound knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms, because when you enter as an entry-level engineer, you will be expected to give solutions in code and you can only do that if you have a logical thinking approach, which I guess, doing competitive programming will help. And don’t get discouraged, you all have a problem-solving personality already in you. You just need to be able to convert it into code. Talking about developer skills, it almost has an equivalent weightage. Because in the future you would be required to develop or modify apps or provide solutions to make it more efficient and for that, you need to know how they are made in the first place!<br><br>
          
          <strong>10. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong><br>
          >> I would suggest you to pick up any language from C, C++, Python, or Java and start learning data structures and algorithms and practice questions from leetcode, hackkerrank, interview bit or whatever suits you best. Learn about objected oriented programming in the language you choose and make your operating system, DBMS concepts good. Also, a little knowledge of networking systems is beneficial. Dynamic Programming is also an important concept that is asked in most of the big coding companies.At last, I would say practice, practice, and practice. One can’t get good with codes overnight.<br><br>
          
          <strong>11. What was the toughest part while preparing for the interviews?</strong><br>
          >>Toughest part for me was to start coding from scratch in my 3rd year. While everyone was getting internship, I was still there figuring out if I wanted to give GATE and go into the EEE world, give CAT and study MBA or start coding with that helplessness in my mind of never being able to code. However, there were a lot of people who were already in the IT field from my branch. Seeing them I realized, if they can why can’t I. I had a decent GPA of 7.59 and believing in myself and respecting my capabilities and limitation paid a lot. Believe me! If I can, You can too!<br><br>
          
          <strong>12. What is the entire interview process for the IT companies which come to BIT Mesra?</strong><br>
          >>First-round is always a coding round. It may have a series of OS, DBMS, OOPS concepts, and proper coding questions with testcases to pass. It can also have aptitude questions. After the first round, there may be 1–3 technical rounds depending on the company. The last round is an HR round. I would say never take the HR round lightly because most of the people are rejected in this round only!`,

        interview: `<strong>1. Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong><br>
          >>I got a full time offer from AXIS BANK, for the profile of Data Analyst. I initially got an internship in this organization in my 3rd year, which was then extended to a PPO (Pre-Placement Offer). The job locations being either Bengaluru or Mumbai.<br><br>
  
          <strong>2.Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you the part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong><br>
          >> I really had a great time during my college. During the initial phase, i.e., first and second year, I explored a lot of potential areas of interest, took part in various fest (cultural and technical) activities, explored Ranchi (restaurants especially).Talking about the clubs, I was in IEEE and SMAC. IEEE is a technical club that mainly focuses on coding and IT related stuffs. Clubs like these are very helpful as here, one can get a lots of knowledge and learning (tech and non-tech) from other members. SMAC is a sports club, which is basically responsible to organize various sports events in the college. Clubs like these help you to develop your personality, make you more organized and boost your management skills as well. The main thing is enjoying your college, make new friends, explore different things to find your interest and keep going!<br><br>
  
          <strong>3.What message would you give to the first- and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong><br>
          >>During the first and second year, I would highly recommended to try different things, as this will definitely help one in finding his/her academic interests as well as it will help them with their personality development. Participate in different activities like fest events, try new clubs, and with all of these try to maintain a good relation with seniors as well because, their experience will definitely help you. And for sure, try to maintain a good CGPA from the very beginning itself (>7.5), so that, during your 3rd and 4th year you do not have to hustle much for improving your GPA (which is the first criteria companies look!)
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>4.How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
          <br>
          >>So, basically the particular sector I am working/learning is Data Sc. (Machine learning and Deep learning). When I was in 2nd year, I came to know about this field and started learning about it. I did an internship in my 2nd year in the above-mentioned field as a research intern in IIIT-B, from where my interests started to develop. Then again, I got a chance in Axis Bank to work under the same fields (machine learning and deep learning) and from here, I got to learn a lot of stuffs and this helped me to move forward in these fields.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>5.What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
          <br>
          >>For EEE students, very less companies come for 3rd year internships in core sector (e.g. — TATA STEEL), but in the placement season, more companies came for providing FTE and 6-months internships, for both core electrical and electronics (e.g.- Infineon, Addverb, etc.). For the students who are willing to join the IT sector, should start to learn coding and other CS subjects (Operating systems, DBMS, etc.) as early as possible, because competitions in these sectors are very high.So, for all the fields, whether it be IT, Electronics or Electrical, the most basic and important thing is GPA, hence try to maintain this (>7.5).
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>6.How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
          <br>
          >>There is no such specific time from which one should start the preparation, but try to start as early as possible and try to target big companies in 3rd year internships itself, as many of these internships gets converted into a PPO, and then one feels relaxed during the final placement season. I pursued my internship from Axis Bank, they selected me for the profile of Data Analyst. I was able to grab a PPO from this internship, and will continue here as a full time.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>7.What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
          >> I have basically done 2 internships and from there I got to work on 3 major projects. And, my personal projects include both Machine learning (Deep Learning) projects as well as Electrical core projects (because these you need to do in your course of study).Your personal projects help you a lot in cracking an internship or a FTE, because one includes these in their resumes and companies basically look for your projects and a major part of your interview will definitely be discussing about your projects.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>8.What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
          >>The whole process of Axis Bank started with a written technical test, which included 2 coding questions and some MCQs. The MCQs were based on statistics, probability and the basics of machine learning. Followed by which, there was a technical interview round, in which questions were mainly from machine learning, my resume (skills mentioned), past projects and experiences. At last, the HR round was the final round, and here normal HR questions were asked.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>9.How to choose and apply for internships, so that we can make our way in the right company that we want to join?</strong> <br>
          >>For on campus internships, always look at the job profile they are providing, and just for the sake of getting an internship or placement, do not choose any company or profile, choose according to your interests and future plans.For off campus internships, I would suggest you make an online account on LinkedIn, monster.com, Internshala, and many more. There are lots of opportunities for internships and placements for freshers/college students. Apply from these sites to the most relevant internships and full-time roles of your choice.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>10.Please tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of our college.</strong><br>
          >>Our training and placement portal is very well organized. It gives you all the information regarding the companies that visit the campus, the profiles they offer, the salaries/stipends they provide, etc. It is very well up-to date during the placement and internship seasons.<br><br>
  
          <strong>11.What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong><br>
          >>My future plans just involve learning , I would definitely try to work in the corporate sector first, know my profile and job more deeply, and then think about the possible routes that I can take further.<br><br>
  
          <strong>12.What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong><br>
          >>The field of data science and machine learning is booming now-a-days. Every sector works with data and want this data to bring some insightful information that the company can use for their profit. So, I would definitely recommend people to give this field a try, if one is interested in it. This field basically requires the knowledge of mathematics, machine learning concepts, languages like python and SQL.`,

        interview: `<strong>1.Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong><br>
          >>I have been placed in management consultancy organization called ZS Associates and my designation in that organization is that of Decision Analytics Associate, which means my job profile is all about visualizing data and coming to a certain conclusion regarding that data.<br><br>
  
          <strong>2.Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you the part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong><br>
          >>I was a member of various clubs and societies during my college life .There I formed strong bond with my seniors and juniors as well.Basically these clubs help you to interact and have connections with your seniors. It was all full of fun. I was in Dramatic Society, Team Aveon Racing, IETE, Music Club, these clubs were essentially the building block and integral part of my college life.These clubs made me learn, how to work as a team and to efficiently manage time. If you really give importance to the club and have a feeling and mindset that you want to learn things, then I think you’ll automatically start managing your time aptly.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>3.What message would you give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
          <br>
          >>Yeah, lots of things, first of all about CGPA and academics, everyone has a filmy feel that CGPA doesn’t matter, well its not like that at all. If you choose to go IIM they will see your CGPA and even later on in your life, it will play an important role, besides that its importance lie in campus placement as well. One should always try to have atleast 7.5 CGPA or above. Then, regarding time management I understood it after getting into clubs and societies in college, unless and until you are not involved in certain activity in college you will not know how to efficiently manage your time. Academics are not that tough if you are confident and a bit self-conscious about your studies.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>4.How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong><br>
          >>I have explored each and every avenue of college life and tried to explore out different fields as much as possible .First two and half year I was more interested towards core, even though during that period I used to practice coding on hacker rank and code chef but not that consistently, it was just I was dabbling with it. I also prepared for CAT in 3rd year, so I got my backup ready. That’s why there was no fear about the campus Placement, in that semester only I realized that I am not interested in core. So, I took part in ZS Campus beats after that only I got interested in management consultancy.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>5.How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
          <br>
          >>I did my summer internship at Futures First, I got interested in finance after participating in ZS Campus Beats, summer internship what I feel is not that important, if u get it, its well and good but if not try develop new skills and hone your them, it’s not like that if you don’t get an internship you would not be able to do anything good. If you are interning make sure you remain focused in that time because you are giving precious time of two month ,after that only Campus Selection starts, then you will not get enough time to develop new skill, it’s quite tough.If you are opting to have internship make sure it’s truly related to your field, not just for sake of being paid for that. I have seen my seniors and friends who had not done internships but eventually got placed in very reputed companies. And for the preparation part, one who is focused to be part of the IT Sector , then must develop programming skills and practice them on online platforms like hacker rank, code chef.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>6.What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong> <br>
          Almost all IT companies allow EEE students to appear for the first round, in addition to consultancy companies like PwC, Axis Bank and core companies like Tata steel.So now coming to my interview experience, first of all there was an initial shortlisting of candidates, who are eligible based on CGPA. For my company the minimum CGPA criteria was about 7.0. So it’s good to have CGPA above 7.5, very few companies make it to 8 First Round was the Aptitude Round, basic questions were asked in that round, make sure your aptitude is good and good and you are fast enough, thorough with your formulae stuff. Then comes the Personality Interview Round , in this round they give you a situation and ask how would you deal with it. For example they will ask you if your project deliverables are late, then how you will manage the client, so basically check your confidence level. Many students get rejected in this round. Second round of my interview was Case Study Round, where I was given a particular scenario like a company launching a new product and we were asked to help in matters like what will be the revenue growth, market share, effective publicity strategies with the help of data collected through market surveys.After that there was a Fit Interview Round, it was basically HR + Resume probe round. For resume part, you just need to put those things which are relevant to them, for example I did not put my projects in IOT, or my core electrical projects in that. Then came the introduce yourself part, for this make sure you highlight your team work aspect of your personality, how you work with the team and they are influenced by that part. Apart from that they asked about guesstimates and puzzles as well , its like you have to tell your approach and approximation to question the interviewer approves then you proceed further its like that only. They asked me, what will be the number of electric suspensions that will be used in electric vehicles in the next two months, in India?</strong>, so you need to have the ability to logically think on that spot. Then you wait for the results, it took around 1 week for the result of ZS. But other companies used to release it earlier as well.

          <strong>7.How to choose and apply for internships, so that we can make our way in the right company that we want to join?</strong><br>
          >>When I was in 3rd year, companies like Tata steel , PWC, Axis Bank and Consultancy company came for internships, one should not depend only on college if you are interested in core electrical. TATA Steel is a dream job for the one interested in core electrical, so they must try for it. And for the students interested in IT Sector, many companies will come, but it all depends on the individual upto which extent he or she has done competitive coding, actually till 3rd year many of us have confusion regarding which sector they want to be part of, that is the reason why many of us have not done competitive coding to that level. If you have decided your avenue late, then make sure you keep trying off-campus. Then LinkedIn is a magic tool, make sure you make connections through it and have a good LinkedIn profile and apply at various companies, if you apply for various companies then you will surely get replies from some of them.So just be active on it.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>8.What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong><br>
          >>As I am not from the core Electrical and Electronics field, and more oriented toward consultancy I can only say one must have knowledge of Matlab as it is of prime importance, if you have really good knowledge of it, you will definitely impress your interviewer, then comes many simulation softwares, make sure you are well versed with it, if you are interested in electronics then VLSI is the most important part that should be taken care of, apart from that you should have deep understanding of the field which he or she aspires to be part of ,that’s what matters the most.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>9.What was the toughest part while preparing for the interviews?</strong><br>
          >>Well for me the toughest part was to improve and work upon my communication skills.It seems like a very minute thing to be a matter of importance but no, let me tell you one thing, you must have fluent communication and must not stumble as it’s the least enticing part of the interview and gives your negative impression. Some companies ask you to speak on a topic for a minute and if at that time you keep on stumbling and repeating your words, they get an impression that the candidate is not confident enough.Apart from this I started on my projects of Data Analysis very late, so I had to go on with my aptitude as well as my projects. For ZS I devoted much time to Data Cleaning and Machine Learning, like one should know how to apply regression models to data, I had done this in both R Programming as well as in Python, so it felt somewhat tough as I started very late, but I was able to go through it. But if you start early then it will not be very hectic for you.<br><br>
  
          <strong>10.Please tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of our college.</strong><br>
          >>Through Training and Placement Portal we get to know about which companies are coming for recruitment, for which profile role it is coming, which branch it will allow to apply for and what’s the CGPA cutoff for that particular company. So make sure you remain active on that portal.<br><br>
  
          <strong>11.What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong><br>
          >>Probably masters in finance from a reputed business school abroad. But first I want to make sure I learn what my work is. I don’t want a job just for experience but to learn things from that.For now at least I am going to work for 3 years, after that maybe I will look forward to it.<br><br>
  
          <strong>12.What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong><br>
          >>I would advice them to first try and explore out as much as possible and if at any point you lose interest in that field, it’s never too late to leave it and have a new start in the field in which you are interested in. And once you are determined to be a part of a particular field, you just need to focus on that part and for the one interested in the IT sector, Competitive Programming is a must, it’s like a hallmark to the recruiters. In ZS it was not asked but in Adrosonic, where I went upto the interview round , they asked Competitive Programming as well. You need to have sound knowledge of graph, trees, linked list and other stuff,make sure you are well versed with it.`,

        interview: `<strong>1.Tell us something about your college life and experiences. How do clubs or society help you throughout college life?</strong><br>
          >> I would describe my college life in one word — awesome. These four years has transformed me into a more positive, confident and a more refined individual. When I joined BIT Mesra, I wasn’t very sure about my interests and goals. However, I learnt and explored and finally got to know my interest. These four years have been a roller-coaster ride in which I had my share of good experiences as well as not-so-good experiences. But all sorts of experiences transformed me into a stronger individual.
          Talking about the clubs, I was not sure about my interest so I participated in the various workshops conducted by the clubs and gradually came to know about my interest in the software field. So basically clubs help to gain experience and associate with more extra-curricular activities.<br><br>
  
          <strong>2.Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong><br>
          >> So, I received two offers, one for my 6-month Internship in Infineon as a Software Engineer and my FTE offer at PWC as a Technology Consultant.<br><br>
  
          <strong>3.Did you have to prepare separately for the internship and the placement?</strong><br>
          >> Not exactly. My resume is based upon the software profile. In both these companies, questions are always asked based on your resume. The questions asked were a little different but both the companies focused on the projects and the resume. I presented the same resume in both the companies and in all the interviews, I was asked software-related questions only.<br><br>
  
          <strong>4. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong><br>
          >> You should have a sound knowledge of your core subject which is quite important for a EEE student. But since I am from software background I didn’t have much technical skills in the core branch. Whatever field you are interested in, you should have very deep knowledge about it. In the interviews, the interviewer will ask questions about your interests and projects, so be very well versed with whichever field you are interested in.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>5. As you are from a software background, apart from coding what did you do, for example, web development, machine learning etc.?</strong><br>
          >> In my first initial years, I had attended a workshop in web development, so that would be my first skill I had taken up. Then I made quite a number of projects in web development and two major projects were also included in the resume. But then by the third year I got sort of interested towards machine learning and deep learning. In my resume, most projects are from machine learning and deep learning only. I had attended a course and one of my seniors also helped me in knowing the basics. When you make projects, your basics automatically get cleared up.In the interview there are always MCQ questions related to subjects of CS, IT like mostly focused on DBMS, Operating system, computer network, SQL etc. If you are really rooting for a software profile, people will obviously expect you to have knowledge about the computer science subjects. You must also have a regular practice of competitive coding because even in consultancies like PWC and Deloitte, the interviewers expect you to have coding knowledge as well.<br><br>
  
          <strong>6.How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong><br>
          >> Internships will give you an edge while going for placements because you will have an industrial experience. In my third year in those two months I had basically focused on working on my own personal skills. Internships are important but not compulsory. If you have not done your internship in a major company, normally interviewers don’t look into it. The major thing is to brush up your skills. Questions are only asked from your skills and the projects and till you are quite thorough with them, everything turns out to be good.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>7. As you mentioned that questions were asked from DBMS, operating system but it is said that DSA is most important. So do you agree?</strong><br>
          >> One topic should not be particularly given all importance. Because all topics are equally important. For example, In the interviews, I was normally given one or two coding questions to solve and rest all were questions asked from projects and topics like the OOPS concepts, DBMS, operating system and rest were from Data structures, algorithms etc. So importance should be given to all the topics. So if you are only able to solve the coding questions based on your knowledge of algorithms and data structures, but aren’t able to answer the questions related to the other topics, things won’t work out.<br><br>
  
          <strong>8. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong><br>
          >> So in 4 years, I basically worked on different projects on various fields, mainly Web Development and Deep Learning. My first major project was a web application where users can share secrets with other users anonymously and securely. This project helped me combine and brush different web development skills I had learnt like REST APIs, database management, hashing and salting for security, Google OAuth, cookies and sessions and much more. My second major project, which majorly helped me get job offers from both Infineon and PWC, was a project in Deep Learning- a vehicle detection app for a self-driven car. Here I used the YOLO Algorithm which is a real time object detection algorithm which uses a single deep convolutional network. The interviewers cross questioned me a lot on the model, datasets and the libraries I used, and answering them was the key to getting placed. These are two of the major five projects I had in my resume.These projects were very helpful for me as not only did they help me brush my skills, but also helped me showcase my grasp on my fields of interest.<br><br>
  
          <strong>9.What was the selection process of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of the interview?</strong><br>
          >> So, as I had said I got offers from two different companies. So firstly, in Infineon where I applied for a software position, the first round consisted of 71 multiple choice questions from eight different sections. These included Aptitude, Data Structures, Python, OOPs concepts, Web Design, Microcontrollers, Embedded C and Digital Electronics. After the shortlists, I had 3 technical rounds and an HR round. In the technical rounds, the main focus was again on my projects and my coding skills. I had a project in Deep Learning which seemed to impress the interviewer. I was also asked a few questions on microcontrollers and also given some puzzles to solve. Overall the interviewers were pretty encouraging.Secondly, PWC wherein I secured a FTE. Firstly, there was the aptitude test. You should be strong in it. And yes, time management is pretty important. The next was a personality test. It was then followed by a technical interview, a partner round and an HR round. In the technical interview rounds I was asked deeply about my projects, a few questions about python. Overall you have to be very thorough with whatever you have mentioned in your resume. If you are not confident about any one of your projects, its better you don’t put it in since a lot of times you are cross questioned about the projects. I have seen people getting rejected in the HR interview as well, so it is equally important to have good communication skills.<br><br>
  
          <strong>10.“Every coin has two sides” Despite knowing the demerits of the IT sector, why did you choose it?</strong><br>
          >> Obviously, there are pros and cons in every sector, but I was interested in the IT sector even before entering college. I just couldn’t picture myself working in the core sector because I couldn’t develop an interest in it.<br><br>
  
          <strong>11. How important is competitive programming for landing a software job?</strong><br>
          >> Competitive Programming is the most important aspect because the first round of any software job will always be a coding round. In fact, not only in the first round, in both my interviews I was told to share my screen and code a problem on the spot. In previous years when the interviews weren’t virtual, the interviewers generally asked us to solve coding questions in pen and paper in front of them. The Leetcode interview section really helped me a lot.<br><br>
  
          <strong>12. How did you practice the theoretical part of computer science?</strong><br>
          >> Since we can’t go and read all the theoretical books and notes on computer science since as we have our own branch subjects to manage as well, GeeksForGeeks helped me a lot. It is an excellent platform for computer science basics plus there are many videos on YouTube which would help you with the same.<br><br>
  
          <strong>13. Are you satisfied with your job, or are you planning on higher studies?</strong><br>
          >> I do have plans for higher studies, i.e. MBA eventually in the long run, but in the near future I just want to work on my skill set.<br><br>
  
          <strong>14. What message would you like to give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong><br>
          >> My advice to the juniors would be that you should not sit idle in college life and always keep yourself engaged. I am from the electrical background but interested in the software field, so it is very common for one to feel that you would not get ample opportunities to prove yourselves and things might seem very challenging at first. You have to balance a decent GPA while pursuing your interests. So basically you should keep up your hard work and never give up and eventually the results will show itself in the desired time. You should maintain a complete balance between your studies and extracurricular activities because your GPA is equally important for being eligible for the companies. If you are in the software field, then a GPA above 7 or 7.5 is good but if you are interested in the core field it has to be above 8. It’s not that you have to keep studying 24 hours every day. You should take part in clubs, events, workshops, Hackathons etc.`,

        interview: `<strong>1.Which company has you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong><br>
          >> I have been placed in Futures First Info Services with a six-month internship and FTE offer, and my designation is Market analyst trainee at the same.<br><br>
  
          <strong>2.Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you part of any clubs or societies throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong><br>
          >> I had an amazing college life experience, and around 80% of the time, it revolved around my friends. It made me find out the other person’s story, life experiences, and struggles, and take something good from every person I’ve met, and then grasp that habit and experiences. I was a part of IETE, Team Srijan, and Literary society. I got into team Srijan in the 1st sem. There I was an intern for 6 months in team Srijan and then I became a member of the electrical subteam. I majorly worked with sensors and electrical parts and components of the car. I’ve done work in PCB designing, harness wiring, electrical CAD design. I got into IETE in the 1st sem. I was the general secretary at that time, and currently, I am the vice president for the same. Both the clubs were related to the core side, and the literary society was a sort of leisure type club, where you can meet people, share thoughts, read books, etc., so that you can relax. Being in Srijan helped me finding the right approach to a problem, taught leadership skills, and most importantly, resourcefulness. In IETE, I learned that always keep your branch with yourself and interact with those people. In LITSoc, we dealt with non-technical problems and problems in social life, and it helped me a lot in the transition from being an introvert to an extrovert. It happens by being a part of clubs or societies, and in the future also, this helps in the interview for a company.<br><br>
  
          <strong>3. What message would you give to the first and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic and social life?</strong><br>
          >> College life is all about interacting with people and trying to get to know the best in them. For the first years, you should mostly enjoy it and try to find and explore your interests. Also, find new interests, go to the clubs’ workshops, seminars, etc., in the second year. Try to get more and more technical knowledge about those interests. Don’t go for the internships as you reach the second year. First, have command over your subject and try to find out the work-related knowledge required in the industries. So choose the direction and just go with the flow.<br><br>
  
          <strong>4.How do you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have an interest in this? How do you carry forward in this?</strong><br>
          >> I was more interested in the core industries initially as I was in team Srijan and IETE, which were core-specific. I was initially motivated towards the core industries as I have done many projects on the core side. I also had an internship during summer, but it got canceled, and later I found this notification about Futures First that they were doing something virtual kind of internship for two months and after that, there is also a chance of getting a PPO if I performed well. After seeing that I tried to look up something, like financial markets, trading. I started learning and prepared well, and I thought regarding the current scenarios about core, and I found this a great opportunity and gave it a try. Luckily I got selected in that, and after the virtual internships my performance was good enough to meet the needs of the company and co-workers, and I got the PPO. The first month was confusing. After that, I found out that it was a very interesting and thrilling field and a lot of money was involved in this field that gave me an additional push. The interest in the field developed throughout the way, and it is continuing till today.<br><br>
  
          <strong>5.What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong><br>
          >> Being in EEE, you should have basic electrical and electronics knowledge. Whatever things interest you, you should go for that, not especially core-related because in EEE you get to know about many things like MATLAB, data analysis, AI, ML, deep learning, VLSI, Verilog, power electronics, electrical machinery, etc. Whatever interest suits you, you should pursue it further, and continue with the semester subjects, as EEE is a very diverse branch, so you have many opportunities.<br><br>
  
          <strong>6. How early should one start preparation for internships, and how important is an internship? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong><br>
          >> One should start preparing for the internship in the 3rd year, as the 1st and 2nd year is just to explore and build up the technical skills. By the time you get to the 3rd year you are motivated enough towards the sector that you want to pursue, so proceed accordingly. Once you get to know your sector in the first two years, explore the companies visiting the college which are related to your sector and start preparing for them. But it is not that important in the 3rd year. If you don’t get an internship in the third year, don’t get disheartened and continue to work upon your skills. It can later get you a direct job offer in the future. I pursued my internship from home. It was a virtual internship of two months from May to the end of June in the Futures First. Later I got a PPO in Futures First itself.<br><br>
  
          <strong>7. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong><br>
          >>The biggest project that I have done in these 4 years was the Formula Car that I’ve built in team Srijan. This is the biggest project that I’ve ever worked on because I consider that working on a formula car is not an opportunity that is available for every person in the college. I was handling all the electrical aspects of that car and that involved PCB designing, wiring harness designing, electrical CAD, physical wiring aspects, and learning some basic mechanical things also. One of the other projects was Home automation that was based on IoT in my second year. I designed a Home Automation System with the help of Arduino and an Android app called Blynk (it is an android app available to configure IoT with android). So I used that app, applied it to Arduino, connected 2–3 relays, and those relays were connected to the Home Automation System. The control of that system was on my mobile phone so with the help of my mobile phone, I was able to control the home appliances such as lights, fans, etc. The biggest advantage of that system was that it was based on IoT so it was rangeless as far as the system was running and I had an internet connection on my mobile so the system would work even if it is placed in another country. And the third project was I designed a fully controlled rectifier in the power electronics lab. It is a project that every EEE student has to do whenever he comes into the power electronics lab. And the last project I created was with the Illinois Institute of technology which was done from home. That project was to study the electrical aspects of two cars and compare them. The company had two-hybrid cars — one was a 2004 model and another was a 2010 model. In Chicago, the Oak Ridge lab had already analyzed the motor of these cars and compared it. I had to do the same thing following their research paper and I had to get the results myself and compare them with those of the lab. That was the most interesting project I did in my four years, and yes these projects will help you in your internship and placement. But the main idea of the projects is how to solve a problem. So the problem-solving ability that comes along with doing these projects is the main factor that helps you in your placement and internship.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>8. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong><br>
          >>The selection procedure of my company was a three-round process. First was the aptitude test, the second was a technical interview, and the third was the HR interview. So in the aptitude test, it involved around 60 questions that were needed to be done in 1 hour, it was 1 question per min. It contained aptitude related questions such as general reasoning, quantitative analysis, data handling, basic mathematics, etc. Then the second round was the technical interview taken by a branch manager from Gurgaon. That was a sort of 70% non-technical and 30% technical interview.They asked, “How did you build interest in this field, and what are the things that attracted you towards this field?” I replied, “I just read it about 3–4 days ago, and it just caught my eye, so I am giving it a try.” and based on my different answers, they decided that I’ll be able to cope up with them. Then they asked me that the attrition rate in this field is very high which means most people leave this job and don’t pursue it further. The answer to this is that it depends upon the person’s behavior. Like I had a behavior that, I know that if I’m doing justice with my work and I’m doing hard work for it, then I believe that I’ll get proper rewards for that. So that was the main behavior that helped me qualify for that interview, and I believed in hard work. The technical questions were, “What do you know about the financial market?”, “What is equity?”, “What is debt?”, etc. These are some small questions related to technical aspects; others were non-technical. And they’ll try to give you some situations in which you will get confused, but it is all about being calm and giving those answers accordingly. And the last round was the HR round. In the HR round, the main thing is to get to know about the company as much as you can and what you can provide to the company, and how beneficial contributions you can make to the company. After these three rounds, I was shortlisted and eventually selected for the internship.<br><br>
  
          <strong>9. How to choose and apply for internships, so that we can make our way to the right company that we want to join?</strong><br>
          >>Basically what I will advise is that there are several internships of different types like some are unpaid, some are research internships and some are different things so the distinctive process of these internships depends on the interest, like what kind of interest you have. If you are related to core, then I’ll suggest going for a research internship, and get to know about the subject better so that it will help you in industrial interviews as well. If you are related to coding or data analysis, then try to go for a company that also has PPO to give you because that’ll be beneficial for you and give you long term benefits. Try to diversify the opportunities that are available for you.<br><br>
  
          <strong>10. Please, tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of our college.</strong><br>
          >>The portal has all the information regarding any company that you want to know. You will get to know about all the interview processes and rounds of any company so that you will be able to prepare yourself according to the interview process. As far as the resumes are concerned, you’ll have the choice to make resumes for different types of profiles. You’ll be able to upload 4 to 5 resumes in the TnP portal so according to that, you can diversify your needs. If you want to go for core you can have a resume that is particularly motivated towards that, and if you want to go for coding, you can have a different resume for that. Having 2–3 kinds of resumes is really helpful. This will help you to be a little flexible so that you can explore different opportunities. And try to focus on profiles that companies are offering and try to compare it with other portals too.<br><br>
  
          <strong>11. What are your plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong><br>
          >>I’m not sure about going for higher studies. I’m currently in Futures First so my initial plans are to do the job for at least 2 years. As far as the future is concerned, I’m thinking of preparing for the CAT after 2 years. But it depends on the future and what are my aspects of the company after 2 years. If I find myself comfortable and satisfied with the job I’m doing, then I’ll continue working in the same company. But if I’m not satisfied, then I’ll try for a different type of exam like CAT and try to get a better opportunity than this job.<br><br>
  
          <strong>12. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong><br>
          >>The advice that I want to give is to try to get yourself familiar with the daily markets like (the stock market) and try to look for relatable things regarding this sector and related to trading. Then you’ll get the basic idea about the terms that are related to this field like “What is trading?”, “What is going short?”, “What is going long?”, “What is betting?”, etc. These are the terms that are related to this field. In the technical aspect, I would like to advise you to work on data analysis. Try to build some skills in MS Excel, machine learning, data prediction.Sharpen your analytical skills, keep yourself active, read the news, check out everything that is going around the world.That’s It.`,

          <br>
          >> The GPA in first and second-year matters during internship and placement. You have to balance both your academic as well as social life. You should not go deeply only into academics. Maintain a social life because it will improve your personality development. My advice would be to enjoy college life to the fullest, maintain your social life, take part in clubs you are interested in, keeping in mind your GPA as well because that will help you in the long run.

          <strong>4.How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have an interest in this?</strong> How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
          <br>
          >> I joined Srijan in my first year because I was fascinated by electric vehicles. At that time, machine learning was hype, so I thought of going into it. After my second year, I attended a machine learning boot camp in Code Asylums. I also worked on computer vision during the Student Membership Programme conducted by EEESoc and did a project on OCR — Optical Character Recognition. In that, we stood first and I got interested in computer vision and machine learning. I also tried getting into core electronics, but it didn’t interest me, so I stuck with machine learning and data science, and I got my job as an analyst in that domain only.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>5. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
          <br>
          >> For technical skills, basic coding skills are a must, for example, C++, Python, MATLAB, etc. For core electrical and electronics, basic electrical engineering concepts are essential. Since you are from EEE, you should at least have a basic knowledge of electrical engineering concepts regardless of the field you want to pursue.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>6. How early should one start preparing for internships, and how important is it? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
          <br>
          >> Internships are beneficial and give you an upper hand when you apply for a job. It is beneficial for your development because you will learn how things work in industries and know about corporate life. But it’s not that important because, during placement, the company will focus on the technical skills you have mentioned in your resume which is of utmost importance. I didn’t have an internship, so I worked upon my technical skills during that period. If you don’t get an internship, don’t get disheartened and work on your skills. Build projects because they are important, and it shows how much practical knowledge you have about your field.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>7. What are the projects you have done in 4 years, and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
          >> One of my major projects was OCR — Optical Character Recognition, which I did in the SMP program by EEESoc. This project helped me in getting the job. This project converts the image text into editable text. Another project which I did was a movie recommendation system.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>8. What was the selection procedure for your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
          >> Deloitte is a consultancy company, and they visited the campus with an analyst profile job. There were a total of three rounds in the placement procedure. The first round was an aptitude test and coding round. I would advise that apart from technical skills, you must also have good aptitude skills. For consultancy companies, aptitude skills are a must. Aptitude questions are also asked in exams such as GRE, MBA, GATE, etc. So I would recommend everyone to be proficient in aptitude skills. The aptitude test consisted of three sections — quantitative, logical reasoning, and verbal reasoning. The second round was the JAM round. You are given a random topic and given one minute to prepare to speak on the topic for a minute. They check your confidence and communication skills in this round. You don’t have to be a fluent speaker, but you must be confident about what you are speaking. The third round was a half an hour interview. The interviewers ask you to introduce yourself. Then they ask you about your resume, the projects you have made, what difficulties you faced during the projects, the practical applications of your projects, etc. They ask questions about the skills and technologies you mention in the resume to check whether you are familiar with the basic concepts. So keep your basics clear, and don’t jump right into advanced technologies without clearing the basics.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>9. Do interviewers seek developer skills or want DSA knowledge?</strong>
          <br>
          >> DSA knowledge is a must for a software profile. DSA will help you in competitive programming and help you clear the coding round. Be thorough with the DSA concepts. Product-based companies such as Amazon or Walmart expect you to have development skills. So build projects because the interviewers will see your projects, and it will give you an upper hand over those who didn’t build projects. Developer skills may not be that necessary, but DSA is a must.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>10. How to choose and apply for internships so that we can make our way to the right company that we want to join?</strong>
          <br>
          >> You can start preparing for the internships from the first year or second year, depending upon you. If you want to pursue in the software field, you have to balance your branch subjects and also prepare for the internship. For consultancies, you need to have aptitude skills. For electrical core, TATA Steel visits the campus. So know the topics such as machines, power systems, etc. Also, build projects to show the practical knowledge of the subject.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>11.Please tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of our college.</strong>
          <br>
          >> The training and placement portal of our college is pretty good. The alumni network is also good. You have to register in the TnP portal in the third year, and then you can receive notifications about which companies are visiting the campus and the eligibility criteria for applying in each company.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>12.What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
          >> I would like to work here for a year or two and experience the corporate world. I will prepare for GRE and then pursue Masters in the field of machine learning in the US or Germany.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>13.What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you have chosen?</strong>
          <br>
          >> My advice would be to have a project portfolio because it will make you stand out from the crowd. The interviewers will ask questions about your projects. Start making projects from the second year, and participate in the SMP program because the projects are of a good level. Prepare aptitude questions for consultancies.`,

        interview: `<strong>1 . What company have you been placed in and What is your job description?</strong>
        <br>
        => I received 2 job offers. A Pre-Placement Offer from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India as a Technical Consultant and a 6-month Internship offer from NVIDIA Corporation as a Software Intern. At NVIDIA, I am working in the Software GPU team.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>2 . Tell us Something about your college life and experiences. Were you part of any clubs and Society and how did they help you?</strong><br>
        => My college life has been all about traveling, exploring, and spending most of my time with my best friends. I was lucky to have some good friends indeed. In my second year, I joined the Environment Protection and Awareness Club (EPAC). I started as a General member of the club and then rose in the hierarchy from Joint-Secretary to the President. EPAC helped me in boosting my confidence, speaking skills, and team management skills. EPAC had around 100 students, so communicating effectively with them and expressing my thoughts and ideas helped me develop myself. It benefited me a lot during my interviews. I was able to communicate clearly and represent myself confidently. I also conducted various events like Jharkhand Science and Environment Festival (JSEF) and Jumanji. I wanted to devote the rest of my time to my studies, so I did not join any other club.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>3 . What Message would you give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their Time and maintaining their social as well as Academic life?</strong>
        <br>
        => I would advise them to move out and explore everything during their college life. One should not just waste time sitting in their hostel rooms. I have seen some of my colleagues practice the same, and they now regret that. College life is way different from our school life, and so here, our Social Life matters equally like our Academic life and Grades. I would not recommend leaving your studies totally, because a good GPA is also crucial. One should try to focus and manage time for both of them equally. Make good friends, talk to seniors, make good social connections. But above all, have fun and live your life!
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>4 . How did you discover that “this particular sector “ is suitable for me or I have an interest in this? How did You carry forward in this?</strong>
        <br>
        => I started exploring different fields right from my first year which helped me to find my interest in Computer Science and Programming. Initially, I started with everything, from participating in annual fests like Bitotsav and Pantheon, to taking part in coding competitions. I felt good while coding and continued it throughout my first year. I got distracted a bit in my second year, but luckily I got back on track because of my friends and again started taking part in competitions in my third year. I did training in Web Development and Python under Microsoft ( in collaboration with Verzeo ) after my first year. I bagged an internship in ISRO after my second year, where I dwelled deeper into Web Dev. I also did a 2-month internship in Pwc as a Technical Consultant after my third year. By then, I knew “Programming and Software Development” was where I wanted to have a future. In short, explore and explore and explore until you find your passion.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>5 . What are the Technical Skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
        <br>
        => As a EEE graduate, you should focus more on performing practicals than theory. Also, try and get into any core technical club. If you could not, try to sharpen your practical skills by getting hands-on experience by doing projects. It will help you gain more understanding of the concepts. Also, they would be a huge contributor to getting good internships and placements. A guy with lots of good projects on his CV and a decent grade has a lot more chance of securing a placement, than someone with a 9.5 CGPA but nothing on his CV.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>6 . How early should one start preparing for internships and how important is an internship?</strong>
        <br>
        => You can start preparing for an internship as early as you really can. But it’s more about smart work than hard work. Obviously, internships are crucial if you wish to secure a PPO in your third year. But what is more important is your skillset. So it is better to improve your skills than doing an internship where you do not wish to work in the future. DO NOT get an internship just for the sake of doing one, because if you get a PPO you lose your chance of sitting in other companies in the On-Campus Placements. So better first work on your skills and then look for companies in your work interest for an internship.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>7 . What are the Projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
        <br>
        => During my 4 years, I have done many projects in C++, Web Development, and Mobile App Development. Also, I did some core projects as a part of my curriculum too. I made an E-commerce Website from scratch in my first year. In my second year, I made some simple projects on Mobile App Development using React Native like Timer, Calendar, and others. I took part in the 100 Days of Code challenge in my third year. I made a library for Binary Heaps in C++. This included C++ concepts like OOP’s, templates and included Error handling to make the code versatile and efficient. I did this project during Hacktoberfest 2020. This was the main project for discussion during my NVIDIA interview.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>8 . What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
        <br>
        => The selection procedure of NVIDIA is short and straight-forward. It consisted of only two rounds. The first round was mostly on coding questions and Operating Systems. The second round and last round was an interview, which for me lasted for 90 minutes. The interviewers were very easy and social with me. First, they gave me some coding questions to solve. These were mostly to check my knowledge in DSA. Next, they asked me about the topics I was comfortable with. I mentioned that I was okay with anything but was well-versed with Operating Systems ( I had been preparing for the same lately). They started from “ What is an Operating System? “ and then deep-diving gradually into the topic. This followed with a brief discussion on my projects. They also asked me some common interview questions about myself. In the end, I asked them for some feedback on my interview.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>9 . Tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of the college?</strong>
        <br>
        => The Training and Placement Portal is good, but you can find it a little tricky to use, so I would recommend seeking help from a member of the Training and Placement Student body. You can find details about all the companies visiting the campus for placements and internships and all the necessary details about the job offer. You can apply for the companies you are eligible for and can upload your resume. The complete list of all the short-listed students gets uploaded on the portal.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>10 . How to choose and apply for internships so that we can make our way to the right company that we want to join?</strong>
        <br>
        => As I cleared earlier, you should focus more on your interests and skills. Even if you don’t get an internship after your second year, there is no harm in it. Focus on developing your skills and work on them. For choosing a company for an internship, apply only to one where you wish to work in the future, and the work matches your interests.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>11 . What are your future plans? Would you like to go for Higher studies?</strong>
        <br>
        => As I have a UG degree in EEE but my interest is in CS so I am planning to do my master’s in CS from abroad. I am planning for the same currently, so wish me luck!
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>12 . What is your advice for the juniors who are interested in the field that you have chosen?</strong>
        <br>
        => I would advise them to first focus on coding concepts and DSA. In the second/third year, they can start in the world of development and build projects. For on-campus placements, focus on sharpening your coding skills. Having good projects on your CV is a plus point. For off-campus placements, just a stronghold on coding is not going to be enough. A good CV becomes equally necessary in this case.`,

        interview: `<strong>1. Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I have been placed in PWC and my job profile is that of a technology consultant.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>2. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you part of any clubs or societies throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
        <br>
        >>I had an amazing college life with a group of close friends throughout. When I first came to college, I was not very sure about my interest. Every new technology I heard of intrigued me. So I decided to explore as many fields as I could. I remember my first year, I would be enrolling in almost every workshop I came to know off. I’ve taken part in hackathons, worked on various projects, enjoyed the fests, traveled around Ranchi, wandered in the college campus, and whatnot. To be precise, these 4 years were like a roller coaster ride for me.Talking about the clubs, I was a part of IEEE, IETE, FAS & EEESoc. With time, I left all the clubs except EEESoc because this was the society that gave me the technical guidance I needed letting me be myself, eventually helping me grow. I shared a great bond with my seniors and juniors here. Overall I would say, I had my part of good and bad experiences here, but everything lead to me being a positive, confident, and refined individual.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>3. What message would you like to give to the first and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I feel these 4 years are going to be the turning point of your life, something you will cherish your entire life. It is the time when you will grow from a school kid into a mature individual. So my advice to the juniors would be don’t restrict yourself to anything. Enjoy your college life, attend fests, be a part of the clubs, socialize, explore your interests, do whatever you want you to, but just don’t sit idle. Having said that, I would also advise you not to neglect your studies and maintain a decent GPA. Maintain a healthy balance between your academic and social activities. Don’t limit yourself. Because in the end, every single thing which you will do here will be a step towards you being a better person tomorrow.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>4. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have an interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
        <br>
        >> When you enter college, you will encounter many complex technological terms, like ML, IoT, AI, Robotics and many more. Every field is going to intrigue you one time or other, so explore as much as you can, try every field, make small projects, find its implementation. In the due course of time, you will find your interest and then you can move ahead with that. For example in my case, I have worked on microcontrollers, embedded, machine learning, IoT, and tried my hand on coding and then finally found my interest in electronics. So hit and trial every field but never stop learning.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>5. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I am not sure if you want to ask about one who is interested in electrical core or in general as a EEE graduate. No matter what field you are interested in, you should have deep conceptual knowledge about the concerned topics. As for core-opted individuals, they should have a very profound knowledge of all the core subjects. Your concepts should be very clear. To top that, maintain a GPA of 8 and above. But for the ones who are interested in the software field, a GPA of 7 and above would be enough.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>6. How early should one start preparation for internships, and how important is an internship? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I didn’t have any internship, but some of my friends had. If you want to have an internship in your third year, explore your options and get to know your interests in your first year, and use the entire 2nd year working for it. Because companies like Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Amazon start coming at the beginning of 3rd year itself. Some core companies like TATA Steel comes around October. If you manage to get an internship, it is going to give you some brownie point as they are a great learning opportunity, you get to know how an industry works, and if you are lucky enough you might end up getting a PPO. But don’t get disheartened if you don’t have one, use the time to brush up your skills and prepare yourself. It won’t affect much in company placements.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>7. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
        <br>
        >> Initially, I took part in workshops and made some small start on projects. I made a — ‘Mocking bot’ which reads a music file, identifies the instruments used in that based on the note detection, and then played it in the same sequence using the python program & machine learning. Another project was part of an IoT hackathon. It consisted of two parts — one is the SMART MART (using IOT) — which used weight detection sensors on racks to tell us whether the item is available or needs to be restocked. The other part was a SMART CART (using RFID, EM18 reader, etc), which would calculate the bill for the items placed in the cart and print it on an LCD. This was designed to reduce the crowd in the billing section.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>8. What was the selection procedure for your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
        <br>
        >> For PWC, firstly there was an aptitude test. You should have strong reasoning skills for it. You can practice aptitude from RS Aggarwal, some online sites, and questions from other competitive exams. You should be fast in your problem-solving skills because time management is a must. The next was a personality test to know about my work pattern. These two were the part of written test. Next, was a technical interview, in which I was questioned deeply about my projects, questions on python, and a few of the technologies I had mentioned in my resume. It was completely resume based, so you should be thorough with whatever you have mentioned in it. If you are not confident with any particular topic on your resume, you should strike it off. The technical interview was followed by a partner round in which a senior associate of the company interviews you. They generally ask you questions like why you want to join the company or why should they hire you. The final round was the HR round. It was just a discussion to know me as a person and about my future expectations.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>9. How to choose and apply for internships so that we can make our way in the right company that we want to join?</strong>
        <br>
        >> First make a list of those companies which visit your college, sort them out according to your interests, see their job profiles and prepare yourself according to the job profile of the company you want to join. Then you can use platforms like Internshala, Glassdoor, etc. through which you can also apply. Then you can go to the LinkedIn profile of your sorted list of companies and enable the notification of their job section. You can also prepare a cover letter and resume and send it to their HR or senior manager and approach them for internship opportunities (for off campus).
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>10. Please tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of our college.</strong>
        <br>
        >> Prepare according to the job profile of the companies you want to join. In the third year, access is provided to the TnP Portal. Announcements regarding companies, career events, and dates are posted there.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>11. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I have not decided yet about further studies. For about 2–3 years, I want to get more acquainted with the company and focus on making my profile strong, and then I might as well prepare for the competitive exams. As I have an edge in the core side, so I can also continue in that field.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>12. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
        <br>
        >> For this field, you should acquire good reasoning skills, aptitude, verbal and communication skills. Consultancy requires you to socialize as much as you can because there you have to deal with the clients and need to express yourself very well. So you must have good communication and problem-solving skills and a little bit of idea about financing would be helpful.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>13. How important is Competitive Programming/Problem-Solving skills in interviews for decent IT companies?</strong>
        <br>
        >> Problem-solving skills are something that will help you in every kind of company like core, consultancy, or software. Competitive coding is the next step to problem-solving skills because when you code, it is just another way to solve problems written in a programming language. So one should work on their problem-solving skills and look out for different ways to solve a particular problem. This will also help you in the professional world because people out there demand creativity. As for the software interviews, the first round is cleared by competitive coding so practice competitive coding and solve different kinds of questions, and in as many ways as you can.`,

        <br>
        → I would advise everyone to make a balance between studies/skill improvement and fun. Maintaining a decent CGPA, anywhere above 7.5 or 8 should be one of the main priority of every student. Apart from this, everyone should try different things till they finally find something that they like and then work to improve their skills.

When I came to college, I ended up doing a project related to image processing and machine learning and after that it became pretty clear to me that this is what I wanted to do. After finding my interest, I always tried to make a project for every new concept/tech I learned. Making projects was very helpful since it expanded my knowledge manifold.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>5. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
        <br>
        → It depends on one’s field of interest. If someone has interest in ML/DL or DIP then they must have a good knowledge of python, opencv and other specific ML/DL libraries like sklearn, tensorflow or pytorch. Having a good understanding of ML/DL algorithms is also very helpful while making projects.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>6. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
        <br>
        →One should try to start as early as possible, but it is never too late. Internships are good if you find a company of your interest. If you like the company and if you perform well then you can get PPO. Not getting an internship on other hand will not have any negative impact. You can always try to improve your skills during that time and prepare for your placements. I interned with the Call Center analytics team of Axis Bank’s Business Intelligence Unit.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>7. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
        <br>
        →I’ve made a lot of projects. Initially in first and second year I made a few android apps. After that I completely shifted my focus to Image Processing. In second year I made OCR(Optical Character Recognition) and Bank Loan Prediction portal which also used OpenCv for extracting information from documents. Then I made a website for showing the trend of COVID-19 cases worldwide and a resume parser. In the field of Deep Learning I have projects related to Diabetic Retinopathy detection and Skin Cancer Classification.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>8. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
        <br>
        →For Deloitte we had three rounds. First round was an aptitude test. The second round was a JAM(Just a Minute) round wherein we were given a particular topic, and we had to speak about it for one minute. I had to speak on Augmented Reality. The third round was Personal Interview. The questions that the interviewer asked me were specifically related to the skills and projects I had mentioned in my resume.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>9. How to choose and apply for internships, so that we can make our way in the right company that we want to join?</strong>
        <br>
        →You should always read the Job Description of the profile for which you are applying. Also, it will always be beneficial if you do some research about the company and the tech they use or the field in which they mainly focus.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>10. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
        <br>
        →I will work for some time and then I would like to go into the research field.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>11. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
        <br>
        →I would advise to have good analytical skills and a decent coding knowledge. Have excellent communication skills to convey what you think is very important.`,

          <strong>Q. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you a part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I have had a pretty vibrant and diverse college life. I made many friends right from my first year and I am fortunate enough that we are a closely-knitted group till now. I always tried to keep myself busy and avoid staying in my room for too long, attending workshops, having fun in fests, participating in various activities. I joined Team Srijan, IETE and UNESQUO and all of them have helped me in different ways. The exposure I received while participating in different international and national level competitions with Team Srijan helped me a lot, and I cherish those experiences till date. IETE was a great mix of technical aspects and fun, and I was involved in planning many events. It gave me an opportunity to interact with some brilliant seniors and even today I talk to a lot of them to get their advice. UNESQUO was a club I joined due to my interest in quizzing but I wasn’t able to stay active for long.

          <strong>Q. What message would you give to the first-year and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I’d say that in your first and second years, you have the freedom to make mistakes without it having a major impact. The academic load is not that rigorous, so there shouldn’t be any issue managing your social and academic life. Interact with as many people as you can, be it seniors or your faculty, try to get as involved as possible in club activities and explore stuff.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Where did you pursue your internship and which platforms did you use in order to grab that?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I did my internship at York University, Toronto in the field of biomedical signal processing using Machine Learning. I applied to the MitacsGlobalink Research Program, which is for undergraduates from many countries wanting to get international research experience. It is a highly selective and prestigious program, which opens for applications in September. I had my eyes on this program from the very start and did not apply for any of the other programs or companies which came on campus, as my mind was made up on pursuing higher studies. There are plenty of other programs like this as well, like NTU India Connect, Caltech SURF, DAAD-WISE, and USC Viterbi. Plenty of IITs also have their own internship programs. I didn’t have a very good experience with my internship due to it being online, and felt that the project was a bit above my level so I wasn’t able to complete it. That being said, my supervisor was very understanding about it. You need 2 letters of recommendation, an updated resume, a Statement of Purpose and your Transcripts (till the 4th semester) to apply for it.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Internships are definitely important in the sense that they give you an idea of what actual work is like, and not just because they help you fill your resume. There’s no specific preparation I did for any internship, I just had a diverse resume and some decent projects. However, the answer to this question also depends on the field you’re trying to get into. If you are into coding, I don’t think internships matter as much as the quality of the projects you do. If you’re interested in your core branch, they matter a bit more because no self project can give you an actual experience of how work is in the industry. If you plan on pursuing research as a career, then they are very important, as working under an accomplished professor can get you a good publication and a letter of recommendation, and an insight into the life of a researcher. In my case, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to pursue but I was very inclined towards pursuing an MS.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the projects that you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> A Majority of my projects have been in the core electronics domain. I have fiddled around with open-source IC design tools, experimented with RISC-V ISA, some basic projects in Verilog, and some in MATLAB related to core electrical, filter design as well. Being a part of Team Srijan, the experience of building a FSAE vehicle from scratch was also a good experience. I can’t really explain how it helped me get the internship because the shortlisting process was very arbitrary and I got a project which was very different from the areas of interest, but it enabled me to apply for other core electronics projects as well. I was also awarded the FAST Summer Scholarship by the Indian academy of sciences, which I didn’t pursue due to a mismatch in timing. I’d say projects helped me here, because I also had to propose a project idea while applying. As my company is a consulting firm, they asked me in depth questions from my internship, but not from the projects.
          
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. If an aspiring student wasn’t able to secure an on campus internship, what recommendation do you have for that person both academically (off campus/ research internship) and mentally.</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> In the case of research programs, application begins way before our on-campus recruitment starts. So, keep an eye out for deadlines and prepare your resume (preferably in latex), talk to your faculty to give you a letter of recommendation (atleast 2) and start looking for different research lab openings. You’ll find plenty of them and won’t have much trouble if you are able to demonstrate interest and have some relevant experience. It is very difficult to get a corporate internship (for a non coder), but you could try your luck there as well.
          <br>
          If you have a good CGPA, also consider mailing different professors at reputed colleges across the country. But this gets very competitive. Personally, I haven’t done this, but you’ll find many resources online. If you are unable to secure an internship, you could work on a good project to help you with placements.

          <strong>Q. How did you prepare for the interviews? What was the toughest part for you while giving the interviews?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I prepared myself for the interviews of core electronics companies only, and was not going to apply for non-tech. For core electronics, I revised analog, digital concepts and some topics from CMOS VLSI. I won’t say there was a tough moment for me in my interviews, they went smoothly. I was concerned about having a sudden laptop or internet issue, but had backup plans in place. In the case of Bain, they had a workshop for the candidates who had qualified the test where they taught us case studies and guesstimates. I had a brief idea about them when I was considering MBA as an option, but attending the workshop made me realise the depth I need to go to. So, I read different casebooks from various business schools and consult clubs, and practiced guesstimates from YouTube.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> They first had a resume shortlisting, and then we were made to give a test, which was very similar to the DILR section from CAT exams. After further shortlisting, we had the workshop and interviews scheduled the next day. We were told what to expect in the interview and I was confident about my preparation as well. My interviews didn’t really consist of a standard question-answer section, infact my interviewer and I solved a case study together where he judged the candidate’s thinking process, detailing and logical reasoning. He then asked me a math question which seemed difficult but I was able to answer it. The 2nd round was immediately later and I was grilled from questions related to pricing models, case studies, guesstimates and some questions from machine learning. It went on for over an hour and was very rigorous. I didn’t feel too good about my chances after the 2nd round but luckily, I got through.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> It was my plan earlier to go for an MS but later I decided against it. I might consider an MBA later if it adds value to my career.

        interview: `<strong>Q. Which company have you been placed in and what is the job description?</strong>
          <br>
          >> The company that I have been placed in is KPMG and my job profile is of a data analyst. In data analysis, basically we have to collect, clean and interpret data sets to answer a question or solve a problem. These data sets are provided by the companies that are our clients and we recommend them proper future steps for their business growth and development. We use various technologies to do that such as Excel, SQL, Tableau, R and Python, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the internships that you have done during your college life?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> In the second year of my college, I got an internship offer from IIT Kharagpur in the domain of Applied Control Systems. It was a 2-month research internship, but I couldn’t go for it because of covid and lockdown. In the third year, I was offered an internship at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. It was in the domain of Reconfigurable Hardware Design for Signal Processing Application, where I was provided with some raw ultra-sonic scans, on which I experimented so that flaws could be minimized in the scans and produce the best output. Because of covid, it was work from home.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Is it necessary to do internships for getting a good placement?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Well, Yes and No. Yes, because if you are having an internship in your resume, you have an edge over other candidates, you will have something to speak about. If the interviewer is dragging you towards topics that you don’t have knowledge about, you can instead drag them towards your internships and project experience to impress them. And no because even if you don’t have internships, it doesn’t mean that the interviewer will point this out. All that matters is how much knowledge and skills you have acquired during the 4 years of your engineering. If you have good knowledge and skills, and you can present it in the interview, you will definitely be recruited.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How was the recruitment process of your company?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The recruitment process of KPMG was divided into 3 stages:
          <br>
          The 1st one was a general round like other companies, with some aptitude, English, verbal and non-verbal reasoning, and data interpretation questions.
          <br>
          The 2nd round was an interview round, mostly technical. In the interview, they asked me what I have learned throughout my 4 years of engineering course, from every domain be it core or software. I was mostly asked about ML and python programming.
          <br>
          The 3rd round was HR interview. I was asked questions like, have you faced any problems and difficulties in the past and how did you handle them. They also asked some technical questions, what were my projects, what were my internships. They asked me about my internship in a very detailed fashion, what all I did, and how I managed everything.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Can you give some tips to successfully give an interview?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I must say, that having good conversation skills is definitely beneficial. You should be fluent while you speak and present your thoughts clearly. It must always be 2-way communication otherwise you won’t be able to explain yourself fully. Also, as I said before you need to drag the interviewer towards your strength, keep them as much captivated that there is no margin of error. Keep their focus towards you projects and achievements.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Did you used to do CP and DSA? And was it asked in the interview?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Yes, in college I used to do CP and DSA and in the interview, it was also asked if I had any experience of CP and DSA. Even though questions related to CP or DSA weren’t asked. I must say CP and DSA are definitely necessary for cracking interviews of any kind of Tech Company.
          
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. From when did you start preparing for interviews and placements?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I was actually preparing for core electronics companies. But during my 1st and 2nd year, I was strongly inclined towards CP and Web Development. I also did some python projects. I took some offline courses in python and C++ also, because, when I first came to college, I didn’t have any knowledge about programming. And then I developed interest in CP. I gained good coding skills.
          <br>
          But I was more inclined towards semiconductor industry. So, I was also preparing for the core companies. I started preparing seriously for the core companies from my 6th semester.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Were you a part of any clubs and societies? How did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I was a part of many clubs throughout my engineering, but eventually, I quit many of them due to pressure from academics. I first joined the Firebolt racing club, but quit after certain months. I had also joined Team Aveon, which again I quit due to the work load. In the first year, I also joined EEESoc, and it was my best decision and I am still in connection with this club. It really helped me with my personal development and learning. I was also a part of IETE and IEEE, and that helped me too.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How much CP and DSA knowledge should one have? If rated on the basis of CodeForces ratings, what level one must achieve in order to crack interviews of good companies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Irrespective of whatever platform you are practicing on, you should have as much knowledge as you can call yourself an intermediate, neither a beginner nor a master. Have the basic knowledge of all data structures and all the algorithms.
          <br>
          If you want to go into software giant companies, then start as early as possible. And keep grinding every day; solve as many questions as possible.
          <br>
          But if you are more inclined towards core companies, and simultaneously you are improving your software skills, even then do CP and DSA regularly, and have a good knowledge of the fundamentals.
          <br>
          But if you are purely into core companies and semi-conductor based companies, then doing CP DSA is wastage of time, focus all your energy and time on the core topics. Because giving those interviews is quite tough.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> For placement in core companies, one must be proficient in Verilog, System Verilog, Analog, Digital and CMOS Digital Electronics, Embedded Systems. For companies like KPMG, one must have an overall knowledge of everything. Proficiency in a few languages like C, C++, Python and a regular grind of CP is a must. It is always better to have a diverse repertoire.
          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>Q. What message would you give to the first and second year UGs on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life especially during this covid time?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I would suggest the first and second year students to give equal importance to their academics and their social life. The first two years are the learning and exploration phase of the college life which must be utilised constructively. And for the constructive utilisation of time, one must understand the subtle difference between ‘serious’ and ‘sincere’. GPA is important. One of the best things that happen to you in your college life is ‘your friends’ and God was quite generous to me on that part for which I am very grateful. More importantly, enjoy your college life.

          >> I had an amazing and diverse college life. It was a type of roller-coaster ride where I made great relationship with people and spent some of the best time. I think I was fortunate enough to make some close friends from the first year only. Yes I was part of EEE Society and IETE student chapters in which right now I am the President and Vice President respectively. These two clubs helped me a lot in different ways, not just academically but also personally. It was fun to be a part of these clubs as along with technical skills, I got the opportunity to build great relationship with seniors as well as juniors who eventually ended up being my good friends. They also helped me to gain confidence and have a good communication skill which ultimately helped me in my interviews and as well as in my personal life. Personally I think being the part of any club or society will definitely help you in one or the other way as it helps us to grow as individuals.

          <br>
    
          >> I would say that these four years are very precious to you all as you will grow as a person in different ways. These 4 years give you the freedom to try different things in your life, yes you will make mistakes but you will also learn from them. Balance is the thing that everyone should maintain, yes it’s difficult sometime but you should understand your responsibilities as well as enjoy your life. Use your 1st year to explore your interests and take part in different activities to learn & enjoy. Use the time to know about your interest by trying different things whether it is software or core. Enjoy your college life and don’t mug-up everything. Use your time to build a strong foundation so that whatever you want to pursue will become easy. I would suggest interacting with people, forming bonds, communicating with your seniors, this all will definitely help you in some ways and you will make great memories at the end.

          <strong>Q. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> From 1st year onwards I tried to explore different fields. I did coding in my first year and took part in workshops which were conducted like C and C++ workshop. I gave IOT a try and developed an interest in it. So during SMP which is conducted by EEESoc during 3rd year, I worked on Smart mart project. During covid while exploring and learning, I developed an interest towards core electronics. So, I started preparing in electronics domain. I did projects in this domain like designing of synchronous FIFO memory. So, these projects helped me to discover my interest in this sector.

          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Many of the students have interest in both core and software, what would you suggest to them? </strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I will say explore each sector, you have got enough time right now. Explore, see which sector makes your work enjoyable. Do projects, learn and at the end see what you want to do. Pursuing both fields at the same time is not a good idea as you won’t be able to concentrate on both fields at the same time which will eventually lead to division of your focus. You might have heard you can’t sail on two boats at the same time. So explore and make the choice according to your interest.

          >> Basically it depends on which field you are working or interested in. If anyone is interested in electronics domain then one must be sound with digital and analog electronics, CMOS digital design and verilog language (HDL language) and for those interested in electrical domain should focus on DC machines, Control theory etc. and MATLAB which is one of the most important skill that an electrical engineer graduate should have.

          <br>
    
          >> There is no fixed time for starting your preparation. Yes, I would say find your interest in work and go with the flow. Eventually your preparation will start. Internships start from the end of 2nd year only. You can also apply for research internships in IITs like Kharagpur, Roorkee or Bombay and you can do the project under professors. You can check research areas of the professor from the college website and apply for an internship. To the answer of how important an internship is I would say that it is both yes and no. “Yes” in the sense that you have edge from other in interviews as it shows that you have an experience of working and you have something to speak on and “No” as it’s not that necessary that if you don’t do an internship it will be a disadvantage.

          <strong>Q. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I did some of the good projects. I did home automation using MATLAB which was a part of SPP conducted by EEEsoc. In 2nd year, I took part in the e-Yantra competition in a team of 4 in which we made a mocking bot using an embedded system, OpenCV, machine learning. I also did the SmartMart project based on warehouse automation. In my 3rd year, I did a project on designing of asynchronous FIFO memory using EDA tools (Electronics design and automation). I would definitely say that these projects helped me in my interviews and provided me an edge.

          <strong>Q. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> There were 4 rounds including the written test, 2 technical and 1 HR round. In the first round, I was asked about my IoT based project Smart Mart. The interviewer asked me about the different protocols that I used and many more technical questions. The second round was director round in which he asked me how I will help their organization as it deals with IT companies and my interest is in electronics field. I answered it very briefly which I think was a very crucial question of the whole interview. Last round was the HR round, the basic questions were asked like “why should we hire you?” and “Being the president and placement going how are you able to manage things” and a few more general questions.

          <strong>Q. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> For this field, you should acquire good reasoning skills, aptitude, and verbal and communication skills. Consultancy requires you to socialize as much as you can because there you have to deal with the clients and need to express yourself very well. So you must have good communication and problem-solving skills and a little bit of idea about financing would be helpful.

          <strong>Q. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I have not decided yet about further studies. For now, I want to pursue my career in the electronics domain, so right now I am more focused there and want to get experience in this field.
