        interview: `<strong>Q1. Tell us something about your college life and experiences.</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> My college life revolved around my friends and the clubs I
        joined. BIT has made me grow into a more confident person. My four
        years were full of vivid experiences that have helped me boost my
        confidence and become what I am today. I was very unclear about my
        goals when I came to this college. There were some ups and downs.
        However, I learned, explored and grew from my mistakes. Never had I
        ever guessed that these 4 years will be so exciting and
        life-changing.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q2.Tell us about the company in which you have been placed.</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> I got placed in Tata Steel. It is a pre-placement offer which I
        received after an internship there through the campus selection that
        we had. I always wanted to work in a core company because of my
        interest in core subjects and Tata Steel is one of the top core
        companies that visit our campus, so I targeted it.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q3.Tell us about the selection procedure at that company?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> It comprised of a written test, GD and PI. The written test
        covered quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning, English and
        technical section. It is easy though the technical section has very
        unexpected and random theoretical questions. It was an adaptive test
        and the platform was AMCAT. There were two panels for GD and GD
        topics were – a)Left is right. b)Aptitude or attitude, which will
        take you to altitude.
        The interview was mostly technical and questions from my projects,
        electrical machines and basic electrical (network theory) were
        asked.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q4. As you are placed in TATA Steel tell us how one should prepare for it?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> Generally, TATA Steel visits during the 5th semester so,
        aspirants should prepare seriously during their summer breaks after
        the 4th semester.
        As I have already mentioned that the technical test comprises of
        four sections, I will explain how to prepare for each one.<br>
        TECHNICAL TEST
        <br>
        (i) Quantitative aptitude: Questions were mostly from time & work,
        permutation & combinations, profit & loss, basic straight-line
        motion, and probability. Prepare it from any good book like Arun
        Sharma (level-1), RS Agrawal, etc. If you have enough time to
        prepare then go through TCYONLINE.COM, YOUTH4WORK.COM, TESTPOT.COM,
        etc. In the last two days go through AMCAT previous test questions.
        Questions were very easy and one can solve all questions with proper
        time management.<br>
        (ii) Logical reasoning: AMCAT's previous test questions are
        sufficient to prepare this section. Questions were mainly on
        abductive reasoning, weak/strong argument, number series, blood
        relations, and data sufficiency problems. Go through
        mygeekmonkey.com for last moment preparation.<br>
        (iii) English: It comprised of passages, synonyms, antonyms,
        vocabulary, subject-verb agreement, prepositions & conjunctions,
        comprehension ordering, etc. Refer AMCAT question bank for
        vocabulary and passages. AMCAT usually repeats questions from its
        previous question banks. During my test, one of my passages and most
        of the vocabulary came from the previous question bank. <br>
        (iv) Technical section: As I have mentioned that this section had
        very unexpected and random theoretical questions, the best way to
        prepare is to rely on whatever you have studied so far. The
        questions in the technical section were from Machines, EEGC,
        Instrumentation, Power systems, and Power electronics. AMCAT asks a
        huge chunk of questions from EEGC and power systems, so one can
        prepare it from the MCQ section of ELECTRICAL4U.COM. Apart from this
        whatever you have prepared for interviews will definitely help while
        solving this section. This section is difficult so I will suggest
        that focus on solving all the questions of aptitude and logical
        reasoning correctly and try your level best in this section.
  
        GROUP DISCUSSION
        I prepared for this round from sites like CAREERIDE.COM and
        MBAUNIVERSE.COM and by discussing with my friends. I was tensed for
        this round but my friends & seniors helped me a lot in clearing this
        round.
        PERSONAL INTERVIEW
        Interviewers asked me from my projects which were "closed-loop
        control of dc motor" and "single-phase controlled converter". Most
        of their questions were from "closed-loop control of dc motor". They
        asked me to explain the project with proper block diagrams and
        questioned me at every stage regarding its behavior in a dynamic &
        steady state. As the project was related to electrical drives,
        electrical machines, power electronics, and control systems, so they
        asked me about different types of controller & their comparisons,
        the functioning of the four-quadrant chopper, electrical &
        regenerative braking, my approach towards mathematical modeling of
        dc motors, etc. Basically, they asked everything, even the minute
        details related to this project.
        Then they switched to core subjects and asked very fundamental and
        basic questions from electrical machines and basic electrical
        engineering. Concepts related to induction motors, transformers, and
        synchronous machines were asked. Questions were comprised of
        starting methods of induction motors, their speed control methods,
        their similarities and difference with transformers, Ward Leonard
        test, etc. A few questions were also from active & reactive power,
        power factor, and three-phase circuits. The interview finally ended
        with some HR questions like my future plans, my family background,
        etc.
        To prepare Electrical machines, one should refer to standard books
        like PS Bimbhra, Nagrath & Kothari, etc. Basic electrical
        engineering (Network theory) can be prepared from Alexander Sadiku's
        books or NPTEL pdf notes.
        Try mentioning your projects during your introduction, so that
        interviewers ask most of the questions from the projects itself.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q5. As you said your projects helped in your placement, what were
        the projects that you did?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> Projects are really important, especially when we want to get
        into a core company as it shows that we have actually worked on some
        ideas and implemented it in our field of interest. It improves our
        analytical thinking and develops our problem-solving ability.
        Some of my projects are a) Closed-loop control of DC motor, this
        project gave me a considerable edge when I appeared for Tata Steel.
        b) Single phase controlled converter c) Digital watermarking and its
        GUI creation.
        These were the projects I did up to 5th sem.
        After working on these projects when I went for an internship in
        TATA STEEL, the project which I was allotted there, was from
        completely different field as compared to my previous projects, so
        the ability to approach a new problem statement developed within me
        by doing projects of SMP & SPP of EEESoc actually helped me there.
        In TATA STEEL, my project was Development of Reliability model for
        motors which involves the concept of data analytics & machine
        learning along with core electrical.
        After that, I worked on the hardware design of a dc-dc converter for
        charging the lithium-ion battery for the battery management system
        and simulation of four switches single inductor based bidirectional
        converter.
        Try doing projects which will help you fetch jobs in your field of
        interest. You must explain the project to the interviewer with
        conviction as he will judge your knowledge based on that. I would
        advise you that for every project keep an abstract that you can
        explain anytime and even to a beginner.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q6. What are the basic technical skills that EEE undergrad students
        should possess?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> First, the student should be good at both hardware and software
        circuit simulation and design. One should have good knowledge of its
        core subjects like power system, power electronics, electrical
        machines, power system protection, etc. The most important skill
        according to me is mathematics which is highly neglected. One should
        have strong fundamentals of mathematics. Apart from these, Soldering
        is the identification mark of an electrical engineer. The ability to
        design compact and efficient circuits is very important.
        MATLAB & SIMULINK and ARDUINO are must for an electrical engineer,
        along with PCB designing software like EAGLE, KICAD, etc. One should
        also learn PLC and electrical AutoCAD. Python and R are also
        important software as data analytics, machine learning, and
        artificial intelligence are in demand these days.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q7. What were the clubs you were a part of? Do club activities in
        general impact placement?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> As far as clubs are concerned I joined EEESoc which helped me in
        improving my technical as well as management skills. I also joined
        IETE students' chapter. The biggest advantage of being part of any
        technical club is interaction with seniors. Pieces of Advice from
        seniors are really helpful. I learned a lot from them. Club
        activities actually helped in my placements, be it technical side
        where I was asked questions from my projects which I did under
        Student Mentorship Programme (SMP) of EEESoc or be it HR questions
        where I mentioned the instances from my club activities. Teaching in
        workshops helped in developing my communication skills. Apart from
        this, multitasking and leadership skills come as an added advantage.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q8. How important is C.G.P.A for our placement?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> CGPA does matter in placements for core companies as it reflects
        your theoretical concepts which are pivotal in core jobs. Core
        companies are a bit more particular regarding CGPA compared to the
        software ones. One should maintain a minimum of C.G.P.A of 8, if he
        or she is aiming for core jobs. If someone is looking for higher
        studies, then he or she should maintain a C.G.P.A above 8.5.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q9.How many core companies generally visit BIT?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> In electronics core, we have Synopsys, Cypress & Infineon and in
        the electrical core, companies like TATA STEEL, Maruti Suzuki, TATA
        Power, Hindalco, IFB, JUSCO, JSW Steel, etc. visit our campus. Apart
        from these companies, one can go for exams like GATE, Indian
        Engineering Services(IES), ISRO, BARC, DMRC, state PSU exams, etc.
        These exams give us the opportunity to apply for maharatna &
        navratna PSUs like NTPC, POWERGRID, ONGC, BHEL, etc or government
        organizations like ISRO, DRDO, BARC, etc. Every electrical engineer
        dreams to work in PSUs or be an IES officer. Now Indian Railways has
        decided to conduct a separate exam for its seats which were earlier
        used to be part of engineering services. A new service called Indian
        Railways Management Services will start its recruitment from the
        year 2021.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q10. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher
        studies?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> Currently, I don't have any plans for higher studies but in the
        near future based on the demand of industry and need of the hour, I
        can go for higher studies.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q11. What advice would you give to your juniors and young minds?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> Enjoy your college life as these four golden years are not going to come back. Attend most of the workshops of different clubs as it will give you an idea about different domains and areas of interest. Find your interest and work on it to such an extent that it becomes your strength. Work on your communication skills and analytical thinking. Be confident and work on the way you speak and your convincing power. You should have that convincing power so that you can tell people what you want them to believe. Do some projects because you feel more confident if you have pretty good projects to present. If you are determined for core industries then be focused, patient and don’t forget hard work  pays off.`,

        interview: `<strong>1.Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong>
      <br>
      → Currently I am working as a Project Intern at BAJAJ Auto Ltd (BAL). And speaking of the job opportunity, they (BAL) do extend FTE offers to the interns. I would prefer to make further choice depending on the job profile offered by them.
  
      <br><br>
  
      <strong>2.Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you a part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
      <br>
      → My college journey was awesome. I am grateful to all my friends who were instrumental in opening me up and making me realize the way to tackle the curveballs from my life. I would like to express my gratitude to a senior from whom I learnt the quality of being patient and that had made all the difference. Yes, indeed I was in tech clubs like IETE BIT Mesra Students’ Chapter and EEESoc. Both of them helped me to discover my fears and provided the opportunities to overcome them both professionally and individually. They were more than a club for me and made me a better individual.
  
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>3.What message would you give to the first and second-year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
      <br>
      → I think the 4 years that we devote to our college life are the only ones in which we have almost all the resources, freedom, time and energy required to learn and explore anything we want. Later on responsibilities pop up and you can’t avoid those. Don’t waste these precious moments pleasuring yourselves and others, instead step out of your hut and spend time with your friends. They’ll take care of your social life. Also try acquiring new skills while focusing on your weaker threads as well. Along your journey you’ll definitely come across some mushroom heads advising that CGPA don’t matter. It’s true to only 1% of the people around you. Believe me you’ll miss some of the great opportunities due to low score. Just give all that you’ve got, score the best you can. CGPA is important but it’s not the only thing you got to work on in these 4 years. Focus on your profile building.
  
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>4.How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have an interest in this?</strong>
      <br>
      → One should always keep exploring various fields by practically implementing them in form of various ambitious projects. The day you come across a field or technology that excites you more than the most beautiful homo sapient in your surroundings, it’s an indication that you got the one you were wondering for.
      
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>5.How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
      <br>
      → The early the better. Internships provide you an insight of the field you are exploring. They act like a movie teaser and save you from becoming John Snow of Corporate sector (helps you find your sector).
      I pursued my summer internships at Netcamp, National Instruments Innovation Center (Greater Noida) and finally in 2020 I got accepted as a Summer Research Intern at Applied Power Electronics Lab (APEL), IIT Bombay. The project title being Battery Management System (BMS). Later being a Lab based internship; I was unable to capitalize on it due to Covid-19 Pandemic.
  
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>6.What are the projects that you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
      <br>
      → Projects are one of the best Ninja Techniques to learn, explore and conquer any field of your taste. A realistic and ambitious project keeps the spirit of learning high, resulting in completion of the project. In my first year, I implemented Web development, web server hosting, android app development and a networking project on Linux. From second year onwards, to get the crunch of EEE-the projects were mostly focused on EEE core. Some EEE Ninja Turtles were by my side, when I tried my hands on projects like Power Factor Correction, Speed control of Induction motor and power electronics converter designing. Sliding mode control of Buck-Boost converter is really close to my heart as it is the project that helped me realize my limits and potential. It took me around 3–4 months just to grasp the concept, later on strengthening my knowledge in the fields of Control Systems, Power Electronics and EV’s. All these projects were instrumental in helping me to get the opportunity as a Summer Research Intern at IITB. In the last quarter of 2020, I started applying for off-campus internship/ placement opportunities and was fortunate to get a Project Intern position at BAJAJ Auto Ltd. A good bunch of projects conveys your overall track record in various domains. This results in a good overall base on which you could conquer your interviews and any other applications.
  
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>7. How to apply for Research Internships at IITs & IISC?</strong>
      <br>
      → Some misconceptions and their real scenario:
      <br>
      1.	high CGPA (>8.5) 🡪 [The higher is the CGPA the better but it’s not the only deciding factor. Projects & lab experience matters] <br>
      2.	can’t get projects under Professors 🡪 [It depends on the fact that your profile interests the professor and synchronizes with his field of interests. Generally, Assistance Prof. are more active in project work hence accepting more interns comparatively.] <br>
      3.	Top IIT’s don’t accept interns 🡪 [Irrespective of Internship programs that some IIT’s organize, various ongoing institutional projects exists for which they require technically sound Interns. So it’s just a matter of a potential candidate with suitable application.] <br><br>
      <strong>General application steps:</strong><br>
      1.	List down all the professors according to your field of interest.<br>
      2.	Apply to their official e-mail id. Don’t hesitate to revert back if you don’t get any response after a week or more.<br>
      Contents of standard application: Resume with a Cover Letter & Letter of Recommendations (LOR’s). Remember to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). Never ever send more than one application to same department of the particular Institute, it can backfire. Be honest in the interview & don’t glorify yourself, mention your skills in e-mail draft.
  
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>8. How to apply for off-campus Internship and FTE opportunities?</strong>
      <br>
      → Create contacts via LinkedIn and official websites. Application process remains same as mentioned above with some minor changes in cover letter.
  
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>9.What was the selection procedure for your company?</strong>
      <br>
      → As mentioned above, I applied to BAL via off-campus e-mail application (to HR). After which, a telephonic interview was scheduled. The interview was mostly focused on my core strengths, projects and resume. Followed by a technical interview at the plant, I was appointed the position of Project Intern.
      
      <br><br>
  
      <strong>10.Apart from a good CGPA, what are the other skills required in cracking the interviews of core companies?</strong>
      <br>
      → Core companies do focus on conceptual topics. Effective communication and thorough subject knowledge are essential to crack their interviews.
      
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>11.What was the toughest part for you while giving the interviews?</strong>
      <br>
      → Making the interviewer understand my projects and their utilization was indeed a challenging task. Sometimes the interviewer can’t justify the toughness and complexities of your project, as they might not be familiar with the concepts and fields you worked on. Explaining the concept in some sort of story is what I prefer, it makes a better communication.
      
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>12.What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
      <br>
      → I haven’t yet decided for higher studies. Targeting my weaker aspects and improving them in corporate sector is what I am focusing for now. Depending upon the need of the hour I’ll further make appropriate choice.
      
      <br><br>
      
      <strong>13.What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
      <br>
      → Power Electronics, Control Systems, Electrical Machine control and System modelling are my fields of interests. The EV (Electric vehicle) sector is a combination of all these fields. Practical implementation is the key to master these fields. Some ambitious projects would definitely be instrumental in your learning journey. These projects will further serve as a Shastra to crack the interviews. Various EV and tech start-ups have bloomed recently and they do provide opportunities for all the talented potheads out there. In order to apply for these start-ups one must hunt for the opportunities via their official websites and LinkedIn connections. LinkedIn is like a Doremon for job search, it’s just a matter of a doracake (an application) and you can get some really awesome opportunities. Following is a list of EV start-ups<br>
      1.	ION Energy (Battery Management Systems-BMS)<br>
      2.	Ether Energy<br>
      3.	Tork Motors<br>
      4.	Ola Electric<br>
      5.	EMFlux Motors Pvt.LTD<br>
      6.	PureEV, etc.<br>
      I believe the fact that ‘We get what we deserve’. If you think you didn’t achieve it yet, then keep working until you hunt it down. Just remember keep consistency and time will show the results. Whenever you enter the dark realm of self-doubt, just have a talk with your soul friend (the one in the mirror) he’ll guide you out of it. <strong>Best of Luck!!!</strong>

        <strong>2. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you the part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
        <br>
        → I had an amazing college life. Since I belong to south India, initially I had problems with language and all, but with time everything sorted out and now I have some great friends. Yes, I was a part of Team Aveon Racing and EEESoc. I was working as a vice captain in Team Aveon Racing and through this club I managed to interact with seniors and as a result it showed the right path, adding to this I learned a maximum of technical skills and Engineering through this Team. And from EEESoc, I learned to build up my resume and focused on projects as a part of SPP and SMP.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>3. What message would you give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
        <br>
        → For 1st year junior, I will suggest to explore more and more, go to a different society and clubs, have fun, interact with people as this will help you to develop your personality but not to forget about the academics, learn and have fun. And for 2nd year juniors, I would suggest you to pull up your socks, focus on your GPA, minimum of 7.5 GPA is required to appear for placements and internships. Explore, learn new things, there are many and many options and do whatever interests you not because everyone is doing it. I also want to do this., just do whatever interests you and what motivates you.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>4. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
        <br>
        → Actually at first that is in first year I was in civil, and in my 12th I had interest in electricity and mechanics, so I decided to upgrade my branch and in 2nd year I got EEE as a branch and also I was in Aveon, where the technical things interested me a lot. So I carry forward this.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>5. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
        <br>
        → For an EEE Student who wants to Pursue in this field then MATLAB and Simulink is very important apart from that PLC, AUTOCAD and PCB design is important for a EEE graduate.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>6. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
        <br>
        → I didn’t have my internship in my 3rd year, but I had my internship in my 2nd year related to electronics from Netcamp National Instruments related to Labview. During 3rd year, lockdown was imposed, so I thought online internships didn’t benefit me, so I decided to focus on my gate preparation.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>7. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
        <br>
        → Apart from Minor and Major Projects I made two projects in my third year that are voltage source Inverter (including Simulink, hardware implementation and result verification) as a part of SMP and Single phase full wave rectifier as a part of Power Electronics Lab. Also in Team Aveon Car Racing I worked on modelling of BLDC motor for virtual event. So I included these projects in my resume and the interviewer generally asks questions from these projects only during PI round.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>8. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
        <br>
        → The selection procedure differs from company to company, so for my selection procedure, I had to undergo a Technical test which includes Technical questions along with general Aptitude and then technical + HR interview. Mostly, questions are from electrical core and my projects which include subjects like electrical machines, power electronics and its practical application.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>9. How to choose and apply for internships, so that we can make our way in the right company that we want to join?</strong>
        <br>
        → First of all you have to be sure about the path you have to join, like software, electrical core, electronics core or consultancy and management. Then start preparing and in 3rd year companies come for internships, apply through training and placement portal from our website for on campus and for off campus choose a company and through their career page apply for internship same applicable even for the placement. For Electrical core try to get summer internship from IITs or from Generating Industries.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>10. Please tell us something about the Training and Placement Portal of our college.</strong>
        <br>
        → In the third year, access to the TNP portal will be provided and any news regarding internship and placement will be posted there, you have to check it regularly to get all the information.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>11. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
        <br>
        → I have appeared for gate examination and if I get top PSUs then I will do that, if not I will continue with my job not planned for Higher Studies as of now.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>12. How was your Gate Preparation? Did you satisfied with your exam and what message would you give to juniors from that?</strong>
        <br>
        → Well, initially I didn’t have a plan for preparation in final year but due to lockdown, my seniors results and motivation from them has given me the confidence if I’ll do it with utmost dedication I can get it. I prepared for approximately 10 months starting from march (my 6th Sem) to Jan (my 8th Sem), Lockdown has given me a good environment and time to get it. Coming to my result, not upto my expectation but Yes pretty satisfied with it. For juniors also whoever wants to prepare GATE, I’ll suggest them to start preparing from 3rd year onwards so that you’ll get enough time and balance from college.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>13. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
        <br>
        → Explore, chill, make new friends, have fun, communicate, build up your personality but not to forget about academics. Do everything that you want to do, but remember why you were here and do what you are confident upon.

        company: "TATA Motors",
        interview: `<strong>Q1. Which company you have been placed in and what’s your job description?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> I’ve been placed at Tata Motors. And my job description is GET (Graduate Engineer Trainee). I will be on a probation period of one year and after that I will be posted at a managerial position based upon my performance in the first year. My position can be in sales, in plant operation or in research based upon my performance in the first year
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q2. How was the recruitment process of your company?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> It started with a written test which comprised of four sections: aptitude, electrical core, English and Hindi. Basics of electronics engineering, good questions on electrical and aptitude were there in the technical round. And the Hindi round was just only there to see if the person can read, write Hindi.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q3. Can you give some important tips to go through the interview process?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> For giving an interview the most important thing is that you have to first clear the technical round and for that your knowledge in electrical should be very good. You must have a very good practice of aptitude also. There are many websites where you can find aptitude questions. Also, you can find websites that provide aptitude questions related to particular companies and you can go there and practice those questions.
        <br>
        You should have at least average skill set of English. And the interview part is totally dependent upon you. The interviewer is there to select you and you need to have a mindset just like that. You should try to be the driver of your interview. You can drag your interview the way you want.

        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q4. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for you? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> In the first year I was not very clear about whether I will go towards the core or towards the coding sector. It was quite vague in the first year. In the second year I got selected in team Aveon and from there onwards I got a very keen interest in electric vehicles and also towards the core electrical subject. My friends also had a very deep knowledge about electrical subject so we used to keep discussing problems. That way we developed a very good interest in core electrical subjects.
        <br>
        From the second year onwards, I was clear I had to go in core. On the theory part I can say that college was very helpful. There were a few professors which were really good in our department (EEE), they definitely helped me in getting my basics very clear. But I would give major credit to the work that I have done for my club. I had the privilege to apply my core knowledge in the club (Aveon), this helped me a lot.

        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q5. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? From when did you start preparing for interviews and placements?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> The companies will be visiting your campus from the fifth semester. Aptitude is common in all the companies and depending upon which company you are choosing to apply for, the interview will be different. You can start as early as in 2nd year depending upon your interest and for the 2-month internship it is not very tough. Also, if you are interested in companies that do not come to our campus, you can go to their website and find out the process for off-campus internships/placements.
        <br>
        I started preparing for my internship after the placement session started and what we used to do is make a group of some students and we used to do some mock interviews. This helped us in improving our communication skills.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q6. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> I had a plan that if I would don’t get any placement, I would definitely go for GATE exam, but now I have dropped that plan. So, currently I will join the company and for better career options I will look inside the company. I don’t have any plan for further studies. My goal was getting a very good placement which I got. Now when I am in Tata motors, I will try to improve my position there itself.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q7. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you the part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> First two years were really great experience-wise because there were many events like Pantheon that I managed. This helped me in many areas of personal development such as public speaking, administering different works. There was free time which I used to explore my options as a career. First year was kind of chill but from 2nd year onwards the students need to balance studies as well as other non-academic activities. I was part of EEESOC and Team Aveon in which I had to work on multiple projects which in turn helped me to gain the knowledge and skill to work in an actual job which will ultimately gave me an edge over other co-workers.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q8. Many of the students have interest in both core and software, what would you suggest to them?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> From my perspective you have to be clear and focused from 2nd year onwards in which field you have interest and will work in future. If you focus on both core and software, it will be pointless for you as you will find yourself in dilemma again and again. Also, it will be very tough to handle both at the same time. In the end you will be jack of both, king of none. Explore every area possible and find your passion. Find in which domain you have interest in.
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q9. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> First of all you ought to have good core knowledge as electrical core is the heart and soul of this field and you should have good management skills also because once you go in this field you will have to eventually manage a team sooner or later.
        <br>
        As I am placed in an automotive company, you should have a sound knowledge in automotive engineering also, you can narrow down on which type of vehicle you want to work in combustion engines or electric vehicles. An idea of the field will definitely will help you to move further in the sector.

        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q10. Apart from a good CGPA, what are the other skills required in cracking the interviews of core companies?</strong>
        <br>
  
        >> Apart from a good CGPA you should have good communication skills and the skill of driving the interview towards your strengths instead of your weaknesses is also important. You should not behave in a manner which conveys your personality as over smart or arrogant, if the interviewer is trying to correct you or add something on any topic you should be polite and accept the feedback.

        <br>
        <br>
  
        <strong>Q11. How much important are LinkedIn reaches? Who should I mostly reach out to?</strong>
        <br>
        >> LinkedIn is the best tool for connecting to professional people if you are trying for a job by off-campus in any field. Let’s say you are trying to find internships off campus then you have to contact HRs of different companies whom you can either message or send an email. So, if you want to have more advantage and opportunity you should definitely use LinkedIn.

        <br><br>

        <strong>Q12. Which topics/subjects are important for the electrical core jobs?</strong>
        <br>
        >> From 3rd year power system, control system, electrical machines, power electronics are important. And the basics like basics electronics, network theory, etc. will also help.
