We are well aware of how the Blockchain Technology field is booming. It plays an important role in various sectors. From cryptocurrency to banking and handling of transactions, every field is or will be embraced by the use of Blockchains because of its utility.

### WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.

A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralized database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.

### CONCEPTS USED BEHIND BLOCKCHAIN

1. Data Structures — Common data structures, such as binary search trees, hash maps, graphs, and Linked Lists in Python, Java, etc are required for understanding the complexities of blockchain. They are the building blocks of any blockchain.
2. Cryptography — Cryptography is the foundation of blockchain; it is what makes cryptocurrencies work. Generally, blockchains employ public-key cryptography to create digital signatures and hash functions. It is the reason why blockchain is so secure and almost impossible to hack.
3. Networking and distributed systems — A good foundation in it is necessary for understanding how distributed ledgers work. In the blockchain, the processing power is harnessed from connected computers. For seamless recording and interchange of information between these devices, you need to understand about Networking and Distributed Systems.
4. Decentralized applications — These are software built on Blockchains. To be able to build a decentralized application, we need to know technologies like Ethereum, NEO, EOS, and Hyperledger.

### USES OF BLOCKCHAIN

Prominent applications/use cases of blockchains are -

1. Cryptocurrency exchange
2. Secure sharing of medical data
3. Cross-border payments
4. Real-time IoT operating systems
5. Personal identity security
6. Anti-money laundering tracking system
7. Supply chain and logistics monitoring
8. Voting mechanism
9. Advertising insights
10. Original content creation
11. Music royalties tracking
12. The real estate processing platform

and many more.

### IS BLOCKCHAIN THE NEW INTERNET?

The current reputation of Blockchain is no different than what the internet had when it first came into existence. It faced many oppositions, and people said that it wouldn’t last long. But the internet paved the new era of revolution. The impact was so huge that it has also influenced Blockchain. Initially, it some time to cryptocurrency transactions, but now Blockchain has overgrown its initial usage and found broader applications in some fields. Because of its breakneck pace of growth, many people are referring to Blockchain as the new internet.

Some key features of Blockchain that differentiate it from the Internet and make it better are:

1. Transparency
2. Decentralization
3. Immutability
4. Easy tracking of information
5. Security of data
6. Peer-to-peer interaction
7. No third party interference

### CONCLUSION

We can clearly see that blockchain is a great technology to learn, explore & know about and is definitely a technology of the future. There is a lot to learn & explore about Blockchains and in the path of doing so, you can use these links as references,
