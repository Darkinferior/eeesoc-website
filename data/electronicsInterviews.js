        interview: `<strong>Q1. In which company have you been placed
          and what’s the job profile and the field that the said job belongs
          to?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I have received a 6-months internship offer at Infineon
          Technologies which is an electronics company where I will work in
          the automobile electronics department. My role will be to design and
          test software programs of microprocessor and microcontroller
          devices.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q2. Were you a part of any club or society in your college days and
          how did they help you?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> In my second year, I joined the NSS design team where I was
          tasked with designing posters, and as I entered the third year, I
          was assigned to take classes, manage the design team, and also
          handle events as part of a team that helped me in improving my
          leadership skills. In the third year of my college, I joined EEESoc
          where I helped to organize events and meetings and mentored juniors
          in SMP and SPP program which aided in developing my public speaking
          and interpersonal skills. Also, I did a Facial Recognition project
          in the SMP program which helped to enhance my technical skills. So
          basically, clubs teach you a multitude of things other than
          academics and give you a chance to explore and develop your persona.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q3. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE
          graduates?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> It actually depends on what a person is interested in. If the
          person is interested in electrical core, they must have healthy
          knowledge of Basic Electrical, Electrical Machines, Power Systems,
          Switchgear Protection, Arduino, MATLAB, and SIMULINK. Having
          knowledge of know PCB designing is a plus.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q4. How important are internships and where did you do your
          internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> At the end of second year, I did an internship in IIT Guwahati
          where I did a project that was based on designing an electronic
          circuit that could non-invasively measure blood glucose using
          optical properties of glucose. At the end of third year, I went to
          Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago where I designed an image
          processing based human-computer interface that could help disabled
          people use their computer using eye blinks and head movement.
          The importance of internship depends on the type of project you are
          doing during your internship and whether the internship will help in
          your career. My internships were research based so it will be
          beneficial for me if I go for higher studies but from a company's
          point of view, they don’t prefer research internships rather they
          would prefer someone who had done his/her internship in an industry
          or a company.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q5. Tell us how EEE students can apply for Immersive Summer
          Internship programs and the criteria for the selection for the same.</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> In the third year, students who are interested in doing the
          internship get a chance to fill an application which is released by
          our college. After the application filling process is over, the
          college selects students on the basis of their resume and/or GPA.
          Then the list of students is given to colleges in partnership with
          BIT such as CMU, IIT Chicago, and Georgia Tech. These colleges may
          perform their own shortlisting and after selection, the students are
          notified and the paperwork process starts.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q6. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they
          help you in your placement?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >>My first project was based on Facial Recognition which involved
          Image Processing and Machine Learning. Apart from this I also
          participated in E-Yantra. At IIT Chicago, I did a project on
          designing a system for disabled people in which they could type with
          the blinking of their eyes or control the cursor with position of
          their head.
          Projects are always a major part of an interview and you get an
          opportunity to talk about things that you have already done and
          understand very well. Without projects on your resume, you will only
          be asked technical questions in core interviews and random puzzles
          and guesstimates in consultancies.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q7. Tell us about your interview process.</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> First of all, there was a pre-placement talk where the company
          gave an idea of what they do, the kind of job they offer, and the
          stipend details. After that a test was conducted which includes
          different topics depending on the type of company you are appearing
          for. In my test for Infineon I had questions from aptitude,
          electronics, C, Python, web development etc. After clearing this
          round, I got a chance to appear for an interview.
          During the interview they asked me questions related to image
          processing which was a part of one of my projects, some basic
          programming questions, questions on microprocessor, and also a few
          questions about the internship that I did in third year. After this
          there was a HR round which includes some general questions like why
          do you want to join this company and future plans.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q8. Any out of the box question asked in Interview round?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I wasn’t asked any such question in my interview at Infineon but
          one should always be prepared to be asked puzzles, guesstimates, and
          difficult personal questions in an interview.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q9. Does vocational training help in grabbing good placements?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Vocational training only helps when you are aiming for placements
          in core electrical engineering domain have no effect in other
          domains.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q10. Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Currently, I have no concrete plans but I’m thinking of pursuing
          a Master’s degree in Electrical and/or Computer engineering abroad.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q11. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in
          Infineon?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> During the placement season, I have appeared for 12 interviews
          with the domain of companies ranging from electrical, electronics,
          consultancy, and data science. For students appearing for electrical
          and electronics companies, GPA is very important and projects also
          play a very important role. On the other hand, consultancies
          emphasize on aptitude, communication skills, puzzle solving, and
          leadership skills. To qualify for any interview, one must clear the
          aptitude round. For this, they should start their preparation from
          December holidays of third year. Then one should start studying
          electrical or electronics in depth according to their preference if
          they are interested in core jobs. For getting an offer form Infineon
          in the software role, one should have basic knowledge of C, Python,
          and microprocessors and microcontrollers. Apart from all of these
          one thing which is really important is to enjoy your college life to
          fullest. Work hard and Best of Luck!`,

        interview: `<strong>Q. Tell us something about your college life and experiences?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> My college life was pretty straightforward. I made some good
          friends and learned a lot of things. Since second year I was part of
          team Robolution, it gave me opportunity to work as a team and
          multidisciplinary exposure to interact with people from different
          branches and different year. Working for Robocon at late night after
          classes, organizing workshops on embedded systems and technical
          events have developed my interest towards Electronics. It has
          evolved me from a school going kid to a mature individual.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the technical aspects that are important for EEE
          graduates?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I'll talk about the technical aspects that are important for
          getting placed in the electronics industry in specific. The first
          thing when it comes to the preparation for core electronics company
          is that the semester syllabus is NOT sufficient. The topics which
          are really very important from the placement point of view are as
          follows along with the sources from where they can be accessed:
          Analog Electronics: Electronics I and Electronics II (up to lecture
          16)/ Book by Dr. Behzad Razavi
          Digital Electronics: For theory- Morris Mano, GATE book by Made

          You must solve the GATE previous year questions on analog and
          digital electronics from both Electrical and Electronics
          Engineering.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. How important are internships and where did you do your
          internship?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I did two internships, one in the summer of 2nd year and other in
          the summer of 3rd year. In 2nd year I did my internship at IIT
          Kharagpur which was on prototyping of autonomous vehicles. We had to
          make prototype of an autonomous vehicle that traversed from initial
          point to destination using GPS with a feedback of camera, IMU and
          encoder. In third year I got the internship from the college itself
          in Indian Steel and wire products. It was a core electrical
          internship. The project which I did there was condition monitoring
          of motor’s temperature, vibration and carbon brushes. It is not
          important that you must do an internship but if you are doing
          internship/training in the field you are aiming for then obviously
          it gives edge over others.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Tell us how EEE students can apply for Immersive Summer
          Internship programs and the criteria for the selection for the same?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> You can get industrial internships through on campus process,
          Employee referrals or by applying through LinkedIn, Internshala etc.
          For research Internships various IITs have official internship
          programs like SRF, Eklavya etc. You can apply through their website.
          Another way to get research internship at IITs is by finding the
          professor through college website who is working on project/field of
          your interest and mailing them your resume with cover letter, this
          way has more success rate compared to others.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they
          help in your placement?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Apart from my Internship’s Projects, as a part of Team Pratyunmis
          I have worked on implementing embedded system algorithm and
          electronic circuit design for ROBOCON 18 Robot which throws
          shuttlecock at desired angle and RPM to pass through target.
          My other Projects include Sequential and Combinational Circuit
          design using Verilog in ModelSim, Closed loop Speed control of DC
          Motor under SMP EEESoc, I2c library implementation for interfacing
          RTC module and so on…
          In Interview after subject related technical questions I was asked
          to explain few of my projects.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q.What are your advice for the students who have an interest in
          coding but are in EEE and also how should they apply for companies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to answer this
          question as I do not hail from a coding background. But still when
          you’ve asked the question I would like to say that if one is really
          interested in coding and wants to pursue his/her career in that
          field then one should try to devote a good amount of time into it,
          by good amount I mean a hell lot as it is not a part of our branch’s
          curriculum. There are not many companies that are core
          electronics/electrical centred but I can assure you that there are a
          hell lot of companies and a hell lot of opportunities seeking coding
          enthusiasts.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Tell us about your interview process and what are the
          difficulties you faced in the process?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> The 1st round was a written round and around 60 students sat for
          the same. The written round comprised of 25 questions from digital
          electronics, 20 questions from analog electronics out of which a few
          of them were based on small signal analysis, a few from the basic
          diodes and RC circuits and a few from OP-Amp. And if you would ask
          me about the difficulty of those questions, to say that those
          questions were at par with the ECE GATE questions would be apt.
          Because a good many of those questions of Digital Electronics were
          directly asked from the previous year GATE questions. It also
          comprised of a coding section consisting 5 C programming and 5
          Verilog programming questions and finally it ended with 10 good
          aptitude questions. This was all about the 1st round. 40 students
          qualified for the next round and among those 40 I had secured the
          highest marks in the written round.
          Consequently, amongst the five panels of interviewers I was directed
          towards the first panel, the panel of the Director of Synopsys. So
          it gives you an edge over the other students if you score such big
          numbers. The interview panel has a mind-set that you are well aware
          of the basics of electronics, so they directly jumped to the
          concepts of STA, which are normally asked towards the end of an
          interview, concepts like setup time, hold time, metastability and
          reason behind setup and hold violation. I was also asked to relate
          these concepts to CMOS inverters. The interview was then driven
          towards the voltage transfer characteristics of CMOS inverters and
          design perspective of NAND gate. More questions came in. They asked
          me to design and draw waveform of f/3 frequency divider circuit with
          50% duty cycle and then gave me a puzzle. The puzzle was quite
          simple but their motive was to check the speed with which I was able
          to solve it. The interview finally ended with some HR questions one
          of them being why I wanted this job despite having a decent GPA. So
          I had to convince them in certain ways.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. Apart from a decent CGPA what other skills do you think are the
          most sought after by the companies in the students while recruiting?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Yes, GPA plays a very important role when it comes to Electronics
          core placements and I would suggest to maintain a minimum of 8 CGPA.
          Companies like Cypress have a minimum criterion of 8 GPA below which
          they do not allow to sit in their recruitments and companies like
          Mentor graphics recruit interns directly based on GPA without having
          a written or even an interview round.
          Apart from having a decent CGPA the interviewers will obviously
          check your technical knowledge. Having satisfied with that they will
          check your compatibility working with a team because in the end
          teamwork is what they need. They will also want to know about your
          attitude towards work, whether you prefer multi-tasking, your
          decision making ability, how would you react under stressed
          situations and likewise. Like they asked me about my projects, the
          contributions I made towards them, the challenges I faced while
          working them out and how did I handle those shortcomings.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher
          studies?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> Currently I don’t have any future plans for higher studies
          because pursuing the same abroad requires a lot of capital, from
          paying your institutional fees to tending to your daily needs for a
          living. So for now I will be inclined more towards my job but I will
          definitely give a think about it in the coming future.
          <br>
          <br>
    
          <strong>Q.What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in
          Synopsys?</strong>
          <br>
    
          >> I think I have already said about it enough, the way one can
          start preparing for it, the things to prepare, internships and
          CGPA.The technical and HR skills one ought to possess to excel in
          the written and interview rounds. The one thing which I would like
          to add that if you are determined for core industries then you need
          to have a lot of patience because you would witness people with
          coding background getting placed quite early and you are still there
          waiting for your turn. But I assure you it is worth waiting. And
          yes, one should definitely get involved in college activities and
          fests as well. It is not always academics that fetches you
          everything in life. Enjoy college life to the fullest, hang out with
          friends because memories are what keeps a man going. Best of Luck!`,

          <strong>2.Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you a part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong><br>
          >> My college life was very great. I had many good friends and I was under the constant guidance of various professors who helped me throughout my college life. I joined Team Srijan in the first year and currently, I am the captain of the formula student team of our college. It helped me a lot and made me who I am. It taught me time management and various technical skills that helped me a lot even during my campus interview as it was based on what I did at Team Srijan.

Attend all the workshops taking place in college. Social life is also very important in college. I took part in all kinds of events like Bitotsav and Pantheon. I also liked to play cricket and badminton.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>4.How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have an interest in this?</strong><br>
          >> I didn’t choose that I have to go in electronics core or electrical core. I was thorough with all my concepts and the projects that I did. I liked to work on electric vehicles. However, since the EV industry is currently in the initial set up phase and not many opportunities are available for Freshers, I decided to pursue automotive electronics as it also plays an important role in all types of vehicles and it was somewhat related to my interests. Fortunately, I was selected for this Internship in Infineon and that too in the automotive sector.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>5.How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong><br>
          >> After the fourth semester, when the summer break starts you should start preparing for a particular internship in the types of companies that you like. I would suggest not to go for an internship after the second year, instead utilize that time in building and sharpening your skills.Some important subjects that one must prepare are Control Systems, Digital Signal Processing, Power Electronics, Power Systems.I was not selected for the 2-month internship at Tata Steel when I tried in the third year. After my third year, I did my 2-month internship at ISWPL(Indian Steel and Wire Products Limited) which is based in Jamshedpur and is a subsidiary of Tata Steel. At ISWPL, I worked on a project of power factor correction systems at the plants.I am currently pursuing a 6-month internship at Infineon Technologies.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>6.What are the projects that you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong><br>
          >> I made my projects in the electrical sector. The first project I did was a replication of a pump storage hydropower plant. In this, we were asked to prepare a model for this. In the third semester, we designed a PCB. In the fourth semester, we made a microcontroller-based digital DC wattmeter. In the fifth semester, I made a single-phase voltage inverter for the power electronics lab. In this, we used MOSFETs and Arduino and we successfully designed and fabricated the inverter. As a formula student, I designed the manual shifting mechanism, exhaust assembly, and cooling system for our car. Also, I was in the team that designed the intake system of the car. I was the chief electrical engineer in Team Srijan. As our team shifted from an IC engine to electric motors, I designed the safety circuit which has to satisfy very serious rules for our team to participate in the event. Also, I did the motor selection, motor rating, motor controller rating selection, and accumulator design. They helped me to enrich my knowledge and also exposed me to the real-time error that can occur. In my interview, the interviewer was interested in my projects about my works done in Formula Student. He asked me about my project and due to my deep understanding of the concepts used in my projects, it made me outshine in my interview.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>7.What was the selection procedure for your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong><br>
          >> For Infineon Technologies recruitment, first you have to register yourself for an exam in the training and placement portal. Then there is a test for either software or hardware domain. I opted for the hardware test. It consisted of 3 parts: mental ability and reasoning; technical proficiency in electronics core; coding in microcontrollers. I cleared the test, and then called for an interview.I didn’t have multiple rounds of interviews. There was only one round of interview and then the HR round which is compulsory for all. Also there was no group discussion round.The interviewer saw my resume and he started questioning me about the multiple projects that I had done. He asked me what motivated me to do this particular project and what was its outcome.He asked me one question about the HVAC(Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system in cars.In the HR round of the interview, they talk about your strengths, weaknesses, and other questions like why did you choose this company.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>8.Apart from a good CGPA, what are the other skills required in cracking the interviews of core companies?</strong><br>
          >> CGPA is very important but building others skills is very essential. Regarding the core sector, MATLAB is the most important skill for all electrical engineers. You need to be thorough with MATLAB coding, using Simulink for simulation purposes. It is used in all Electrical engineering applications as we can simulate the system virtually and can also take into consideration the external factors like changes in temperature and dynamically changing variables.It will be an advantage if you have knowledge about microcontrollers and their coding like Arduino Uno and Arduino IDE.C/C++ is a basic skill for all engineers.Other skills like PCB designing and troubleshooting problems in various software are also helpful.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>9.How to prepare for exams like GATE, IES, DMRC, etc. to apply for PSUs like NTPC, POWERGRID, ONGC, BHEL, etc, or government organizations like ISRO, DRDO, BARC, etc.?</strong><br>
          >> If you want to perform well in exams like GATE and IES, you need to start preparing for it after the second year itself as it takes a lot of time. You should be thorough with all the concepts and practice a lot of questions. Start preparing for subjects like Basic Electrical, Basic Electronics, Digital Electronics, Network Theory and System Theory. You should pay attention to the subject while it is being taught in the class and make proper notes, especially focusing on numericals. You need to have a good command on Engineering Mathematics and General Knowledge also. Prepare the subject ‘Switchgear and protection’ in seventh semester. Based on your GATE score, you can apply for M.Tech or Phd in NITs, IIITs, IITs and you can also apply for jobs in PSUs. Government organisations like ISRO take other exams as well.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>10.What was the toughest part for you while giving the interviews?</strong><br>
          >> The toughest part was being able to present myself in front of the interviewer. It is very important to express yourself confidently. So apart from sufficient technical skills, you need to have good communication skills. I was fortunate that my interview was very much based on the projects that I had done. Try not to get nervous if the interviewer asks an out of the box question.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>11.What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong><br>
          >> Currently I don’t plan to go for higher studies for at least three or four years as I want to gain some experience in the corporate world. Once I get settled, I’d like to go for MS. Since I am interested in EVs, I plan on going to Germany for MS as it is an automotive sector hub.
          <br><br>
  
          <strong>12.What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong><br>
          >>I would suggest the juniors start preparing for electronics core subjects along with Embedded C. Also try to do as many projects as you can in this particular field that will help you in interviews. A general advice to all juniors, practice Aptitude questions as well. They play a major role in initial shortlisting of most of the companies and will help you a lot in future as well.`,

        interview: `<strong>1. Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. I’ve been placed in a company named “Addverb” and my job profile is of a “Project Engineer — GET”. Addverb is basically a industrial automation company which is working with the tech side of Industry 4.0 i.e. robotics, automation, IoT and embedded systems.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>2. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you the part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. I had an amazing college life with a bunch of talented people and my mates around. It was overall a good journey, but definitely got impacted a lot by the current covid situation because out of 4 years of engineering, we could only enjoy 2.5 years of it. I’ve been a part of EEESoc from the 2nd year and currently I’m the President of this club. Apart from that, I was not in any other club because EEESoc was already fulfilling whatever I was trying to explore in my 2nd year.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>3. What message would you give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. The first thing I would like to say is just explore the opportunities.You cannot restrict yourself in the very beginning of your engineering career to any field, just because others are doing it. Adding to this, don’t think much about the internships and placements, all you need to do is to stick to the fundamentals of the field which you are looking forward to make your career. It’s completely going to be your own journey,so don’t think about what others are doing. Coming to social life,we all know that college is not just about studying. You are not supposed to be a bookworm but I would also advise you not to neglect your studies and maintain a decent GPA. Academics is a part of life. Effective time management and drawing lines between your social and academic life completely depends on one individual.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>4. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. I have always been interested in IoT, Robotics, Embedded systems and other electronics driven things. In the first year, I was introduced to terms like core part or software part. It might sound challenging to be in the field of core, but all you just have to focus on the right things. I did a bit of software part two in first year. But something that I figured out was you can’t really decide your interest without exploring all of them or by seeing anyone else around. In my 2nd this year, I went for a boot camp at Linux world in Jaipur where they taught some technologies like IoT, Machine Learning, Linux as Operating Systems. I found them all interesting but not something that was driving me. From My 2nd year, though it was confusing but I decided to be in the field of embedded systems and VLSI. Many companies like Synopsys and Mentor Graphics came to recruit our seniors, which motivated me more to dive deep in the field of VLSI.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>5. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. In the summer of 2nd year,I interned at Linux world in Jaipur where I learnt IOT,ML, Linux and got certified with Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) also. In my 3rd year, I was the part of Siemens EDA in the field of design and verification of electronic circuits. If you are looking forward to having experience in your field, it’s perfectly very helpful. But if you don’t get an internship in your field, it makes no sense to do it just for the sake of having one.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>6. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. In my 2nd year, we went for the national finals of a competition at IIT Bombay where we had made a project related to IoT called ‘Smart Mart’ based on warehouse automation. Simultaneously, we participated in E-yantra which was a robotics competition and did a project related to audio processing, machine learning and embedded systems. I have also won 4 consecutive hackathons with SKYFI Labs in the field of Robotics, IoT etc. In the 3rd year, I have done the project on design and verification of 32-Bit Instruction word register using Siemens EDA tools (Electronic design and automation) and System Verilog.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>7. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. There were four rounds of interview: two were technical and two were HR rounds. There were no written tests for this company, they directly shortlisted for the first round based on the resumes. In the first round, I was asked questions related to my IoT project ‘Smart Mart’ and E-yantra project. I was asked a question about different communication protocols used in the field of electronics. In the second round I was asked about microprocessors and Robotics. Then, they asked me questions related to the various projects that I had done during internships. In the 3rd round (HR round), I was questioned about the challenges that I faced while leading my team to the finals at IIT Bombay and also about my role as the President of EEESoc. The fourth round was actually an interaction with the co-founder of the company which is basically robotics and automation driven.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>8. What is the best way to study during electronics core preparation?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. I’ll talk about the technical aspects that are important for getting placed in electronics industry in specific. The first thing when it comes to the preparation for core electronics company is that the semester syllabus is not sufficient. The topics which are really very important from the placement point of view in the field of electronics are as follows along with the sources from where they can be accessed:
        <br><br>
        Analog Electronics: Electronics I and Electronics II (up to lecture 16)/ Book by Te. Behzad Razavi or all about electronics( Youtube channel).
        <br><br>
        Digital Electronics: For theory- Morris Mano, GATE book by Made easy, Lectureseries by Prof.S. Srinivasan IIT Madras.
        <br><br>
        CMOS Digital Electronics: — From Jan M. Rabaey (Chapters 3, 5 and 6)/ Lecture on Digital VLSI by Dr. Sudeb Dasgupta.
        <br><br>
        Verilog HDL: — Lecture series by Dr. Indranil Sengupta IIT Kharagpur. System Verilog: — Chipverify.com (not necessary but will give you an edge).
        <br><br>
        Computer organization and architecture:- Pipelining, Amdahl’s Law, Cache memory, Virtual Memory from lectures by Dr. Ajit Pal.
        <br><br>
        Static Timing Analysis: — From vlsiexperts.com/Lecture 33, 34 by prof TuhinSubhra Chakraborty IIT Kharagpur.
        <br><br>
        Memories: — ROM (Basics), RAM- SRAM (6T) and DRAM (1T) (CompleteOperation) from lecture by Dr. Amitava Dasgupta, IIT Madras. Microprocessor and Microcontroller: 8085 from R. Gaonkar, 8086 Architecture, Microcontroller Architecture (8051).
        <br><br>
        Apart from these the other topics are RLC circuit in depth analysis, Active and Passive Filters, Fabrication Process, ASIC Design Methodology, Frequency divider circuits (f/2, f/3 with 50% duty cycle from Ganesh Acharya video), FIFO Depth calculation. You must solve the GATE previous year questions on analog and digital electronics from both Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>9. How to apply for off-campus Internship and FTE opportunities?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. The ultimate hiring platform to get job and internship opportunities is <strong>LinkedIn</strong>. Continuously maintaining and updating your LinkedIn profile is very important. Companies post about job positions and internship opportunities you can apply for them.You can search for opportunities according to your field. Make good connections with people in the companies of your field and also the alumni of our college.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>10. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. I haven’t decided yet about my future plans of further studies. But maybe after 3–4 years of getting suitable experience in the corporate sector, I may plan for further studies(MS) in the field of Computer Architecture, VLSI or robotics. MBA is also a good career option. But as I said earlier I am going to explore the market first and let it be with the flow.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>11. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
        <br>
        Ans. My advice would be to just follow your instincts and prepare according to the job profile of the companies you want to join. If you want to build your career in the electronics field, give your best without thinking much about what other people are doing. It is important to mention here that the per person worth is more in the electronics field compared to the IT field because of the less populations of electronics students going into the core field. Last but not the least, you are here to write your own journey and not to follow the crowd. So, whatever you decide to take on, do it with the right intent and passion.`,

        <br>
        >> I have been placed in “Synopsys” for the ASIC Digital Design Engineer role.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>2. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you the part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
        <br>
        >> My college life was pretty exciting but it definitely got impacted a lot by the Covid situation because out of 4 years of engineering, we could only enjoy 1.5 years of it. I made some good friends that made my college life easy. I’ve been part of the Robolution club since my 2nd year, and currently I’m the Vice President of this club. This gave me the opportunity to work as a team and gave multidisciplinary exposure to interact with people from different branches and different years. Working for Robocon at late night after classes taught me how to maintain a proper work-life balance. Organizing workshops on various robotics topics and technical events developed my interest in Electronics even more. Clubs provide you with the opportunity to interact with your seniors more frequently, which is always a plus point, as they can help you with your academic doubts, placement related doubts, project-related doubts and much more. In short, clubs help you become a mature and versatile person.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>3. What message would you give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
        <br>
        >> For first/second-year students, my advice would be that you should enjoy every moment, try to explore the opportunities. You cannot restrict yourself at the very beginning of your engineering career to any field just because others are doing it. At this point, you should not think too much about placements and internships, just try to maintain a decent CGPA. You need to find your interests because that will surely help you in future. Try making new friends, exploring new things. Try maintaining a good balance between academic and social life.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>4. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I explored many domains starting from electronics core to electrical core to web development and web technologies. Something that I figured out was you can’t really decide your interest without exploring all of them. In my first two years, I was only interested in Electronics, Robotics, Cad and all. During the lockdown, I learned about web development but I knew that wasn’t enough for software companies as you need to know a lot of things with that like DSA, DBMS and other computer core subjects. I started preparing for electronics core companies in the 6th semester, although I didn’t have much idea about VLSI, and HDLs at that time but still I wanted to pursue my career in the field of electronics. Many big companies like Infineon and NXP came to recruit our seniors, which motivated me even more to dive deep into the field of VLSI.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>5. Many of the students have interest in both core and software domain, what would you suggest to them?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I also had interest in both core and software so one needs to follow his/her instincts and prepare accordingly. Let me tell you the difference between these two, keeping placement in mind. A lot of software companies come to BIT every year and hire a lot of students but the problem is that competition here is much more as students from all branches prepare for software companies. So you can get rejected sometimes but you need to keep patience and you will surely get placed. Now talking about the core placement scenario, very few good companies come to BIT like Synopsys, Infineon, NXP, Addverb, Steradian and a few more. But the main advantage is that competition here is quite less as you need to compete with your branch students only, and if you have prepared well enough then you can easily grab a job in core companies, just try to keep your basics at the very best.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>6. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
        <br>
        >> For electrical core companies like Tata Steel one needs to have a good knowledge of electrical machines, power system, power electronics, EEGC. MATLAB & SIMULINK and ARDUINO are must for an electrical engineer, along with PCB designing software like EAGLE, KICAD, etc. One should also learn PLC and electrical AutoCAD. When it comes to the preparation for a core electronics company, you should be thorough with the core subjects that are in the semester syllabus, but that’s not sufficient. Apart from that, the topics that are very important from the placement point of view are as follows:- Digital Electronics: GATE book by Made easy, Lecture series by Prof. S. Srinivasan IIT Madras, Neso Academy Analog Electronics: Electronics I and Electronics II (up to lecture 16)/ Book by Dr. Behzad Razavi (for numerical and theory as well) CMOS Digital Electronics: — From Jan M. Rabaey (Chapters 3, 5, and 6)/ Lecture on Digital VLSI by Dr. SudebDasgupta IIT Roorkee. Verilog HDL: — Lecture series by Dr. IndranilSengupta IIT Kharagpur/Book by Samir Palnitkar(First 8 chapters). Computer organization and architecture: — Pipelining, Amdahl’s Law, Cache memory, Virtual Memory from lectures by Dr. Ajit Pal/COA lecture series by Gate Smashers. For virtual memory refer to videos by David Black-Schaffer on YouTube. Static Timing Analysis: — From vlsiexperts.com/Lecture 33 and 34 by Prof. TuhinSubhra Chakraborty IIT Kharagpur. Memories: — ROM (Basics), RAM- SRAM (6T), and DRAM (1T) (Complete Operation) from a lecture by Dr. Amitava Dasgupta, IIT Madras. Microprocessor and Microcontroller: 8085 from R. Gaonkar/A.P. Malvino, 8086 Architecture, Microcontroller Architecture (8051). Apart from these, the other topics are RLC circuit in-depth analysis (for this you can refer to Lecture Series by Gate academy), Active and Passive Filters, Fabrication Process, ASIC Design Methodology, Frequency divider circuits (f/2, f/3 with 50% duty cycle from Ganesh Acharya video), FIFO Depth calculation. You must solve the GATE previous year questions on analog and digital electronics. One should also have a good knowledge of the C/Python language.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>7. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
        <br>
        >> First of all, you need to know in which field you are interested. For this, I would suggest keep on exploring in your 1st year, and if you are interested in coding, then start right away from your 2nd year since companies like Microsoft and Goldman Sachs start coming to college at the start of 3rd year. And if you are still confused between core and coding, take a little bit more time in your 2nd year and make the right choice. Internships are good for your personal growth as they give you the exposure to work as a team and you get to learn a lot of things during internships. During placement interview, internships help a lot as you can restrict your interview to the project and project-related questions you have done during internship. But if you don’t get an internship in your field, it makes no sense to do it just for the sake of having one. I interned at Vbuild as a web developer.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>8. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
        <br>
        >> Apart from my Internship’s Projects, as a part of Team Robolution I have worked on CAD models and prototyping of bots, implementing embedded system algorithm and electronic circuit designs for ROBOCON 2020 which passes rugby ball to another bot and then that bot kicks the ball to the goalpost. My other Projects includes Sequential and Combinational Circuit design using Verilog in Xilinx, Bluetooth controlled quadruped bot, a 2-of self-balancing platform, a few websites for clubs and various competitions/hackathons and my portfolio website.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>9. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
        <br>
        >> The 1st round was a written round and around 80 students sat for the same. The written round comprised of 30 questions from digital electronics, around 10 questions from analog electronics, out of which a few of them were based on small-signal analysis, a few from the basic diodes and RC circuits and a few from OP-Amp. And if you would ask me about the difficulty of those questions, to say that those questions were at par with the ECE GATE questions would be apt. Because a good many of those questions of Digital Electronics were directly asked from the previous year GATE questions. It also comprised of a few questions from Verilog and operating systems and finally it ended with ten good aptitude questions. This was all about the 1st round. 28 students qualified for the next round, and among those 28, I had secured the highest marks in the written round. The interview panel has a mindset that you are well aware of the basics of electronics, so they directly jumped to the concepts of STA, concepts like setup time, hold time, meta-stability and reason behind setup and hold violation. Then they asked me various methods to avoid meta-stability. The interview was then driven towards the sequential circuit designing and concepts. Questions were mainly related to counters, their design, why synchronous counter is better than asynchronous one and so on. They asked me to write Verilog code for synchronous counter, and then they asked a few questions based on that. Then there were some resume based questions, questions based on projects and internships and about my responsibilities as a vice president of team Robolution. Then they asked me a puzzle. The puzzle was quite simple but their motive was to check the speed with which I was able to solve it. The interview finally ended with some HR questions, one of them being whether I want to go for higher studies or not. This is a tricky question so one needs to answer these questions smartly.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>10. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
        <br>
        >> Currently I don’t have any future plans for higher studies. As of now I will try to maintain a good work-life balance and will try to explore new things. So for now I will be inclined more towards my job but I will definitely give a think about it in the coming future.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>11. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
        <br>
        >> My advice would be, you first need to know in which domain you want to proceed. Well, for IT sector jobs, the major focus remains on the Data Structure and Algorithm portions. Try to learn and implement new algorithms. Websites like Geek for Geeks, Hacker Earth, TopCoder have some great articles that you can read. Once you have gone through the basic algorithms start practicing questions on Leetcode or Interview Bit. The set of coding questions that are asked in interviews is pretty exhaustive, and you don’t have to be a Competitive programmer to crack these interviews (if you enjoy doing CP then its always good). Keep your basic concepts of core Computer Science subjects like Operating Systems and DBMS clear. Oops is often asked in-depth and it may become tricky. MySql queries are also asked often. And for core sector I guess I have already told you about the things you need to know. The most important topics are digital electronics, STA and VLSI. Try writing Verilog codes more often as you can easily forget basic things if you do not practice regularly. And yes, GPA is important but anything above 8.2–8.3 will be good. What really matters is giving your 100% in written test because that will really help you in your selection. Try to score as much as you can in written test and be thorough with basics and you will surely get selected.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>12. Apart from a good CGPA, what are the other skills required in cracking the interviews of core companies?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I guess the most important thing is confidence. You need to answer the questions confidently yet calmly. You should not rush with your answers and try to bend the questions to the topics you know well. You should be thorough with your resume. Don’t put anything in your resume which you are not confident of. If you have done two-three good projects in VLSI domain, then that’s a bonus for sure because then most of the questions will be related to your projects only. Also try to solve puzzles because these are also asked at the last of an interview.

        interview: `<strong>1. Which company have you been placed in and what’s the job description?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I have been placed in Logic fruit Technologies as an FPGA designer. It’s based in Gurgaon and I’m currently an intern in this company with the role of research and development.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>2. Tell us something about your college life and experiences. Were you the part of any club or society throughout your college life and how did they help you?</strong>
        <br>
        >> It has been great excluding those one and a half years of pandemic. I was a part of Team Srijan since 2018 and currently I’m leading the electrical sub team. Being a part of this team has taught me a lot of things including hard work, discipline and how to interact with others. When you make a mistake in academics it can only affect you but when you are in a team, making a mistake affects the whole team. So to take the team with you as far as you go is a very good experience along with doing other things that you want.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>3. What message would you give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I think it should be balanced, not too much weight on either of the sides. They should enjoy but should not completely forget about their academics because during the placement interviews, some of the important concepts learnt in first and second year are also asked.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>4. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
        <br>
        >> As far as discovering, I didn’t actually think that I would be going into this job profile. When Logic Fruit came for recruitment, I just applied without thinking much about job profile. Actually I was preparing for electrical companies while I was manufacturing an EV but I thought I should apply to it because I also had knowledge of electronics. When I actually cleared the test and it was the time for interview, I started studying electronics more in the digital part and after three rounds of interviews which took place in course of one month I finally got selected. FPGA is the kind of role that suits me because in EV design I had experience of motor controllers, battery management system design and field programmable gate array that is used for further fine-tuning and optimizing the controller.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>5. Many of the students have interest in both core and software domain, what would you suggest to them?</strong>
        <br>
        >> It depends on person to person. Some can manage both the core as well as software domains but others have to choose one and they have to prioritize it based upon their skills and strengths. The most important thing is that you should decide it according to your interest and you must enjoy it.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>6. What are the technical skills that are important for EEE graduates?</strong>
        <br>
        >> Regarding technical skills, first of all MATLAB is the most important and most extensively used software in EEE core, so you must have a good command over it. The major topics of EEE which any core company can ask in a test or in an interview are power systems, power electronics and electrical machines. For software companies or consultancies, you need to start by preparing for certain languages like Python and C or C++.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>7. How early one should start preparing for internships and how important an internship is? Where did you pursue your internship?</strong>
        <br>
        >> During your first year, you need to find your interest by continuing to explore. You should start preparing for your particular sector in the 2nd year since companies start coming to college from the start of the 3rd year for internships. However, my perspective is that you shouldn’t give yourself too much stress about it as many of my batch mates didn’t get any internship but got placed in good companies. I did my internship at ElectricFish Energy Inc. It’s a start-up based in California, USA.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>8. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
        <br>
        >> First and foremost my biggest and most favourite project was TSE-21, the first electric formula prototype race car of Team Srijan. It is the best by far. I am the Electrical Lead of the Team. This project gave me a lot of insightful ideas, skills and amplified my knowledge. Once you are into something that is in your field of interest, then you come out more improved and developed. Along with this I’ve also done projects like LQR based speed control of Induction Motor, SVPWM based control of 3-phase VSI. The projects that you do definitely help you during your internship and placement provided that you stay in the same domain as your projects. Even if your domain has changed it helps you in the way you manage things, deadlines, and documentation as well as communication skills.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>9. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
        <br>
        >> For getting placed in the field of electronics, one should thoroughly study digital electronics from A-Z, they should know everything but not in much detail. Few basic things that you should know in detail are multiplexer-demultiplexer, encoders-decoders, number systems, finite state machines, static timing analysis, block domain crossings and FIFO buffers like asynchronous and synchronous FIFO are very important. These are the basic and most important things that a student looking for a FPGA job profile must look into and also he/she should be well versed with a hardware descriptive language like Verilog/VHDL, then they would make themselves a strong contender for a good placement.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>10. Apart from a good CGPA, what are the other skills required in cracking the interviews of core companies?</strong>
        <br>
        >> Other than CGPA, core companies basically look for your projects done and the skills that you possess. If you haven’t done an internship then I don’t think there’s any problem but you should do couple of projects in core domain because they expect some good achievements in core domain and they will hire you on the basis of your knowledge only. So, do some good projects which are also kind of unique.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>11. How did you prepare for the interviews? What was the toughest part for you while giving the interviews?</strong>
        <br>
        >> The toughest part for me while giving my interview was that this was an electronics company but I was prepared more for electrical core. I didn’t prepare for it much as I wasn’t expecting to be interviewed by an electronics domain company so I did selective study and prepared the most important topics that I had told earlier. I prepared for interview questions that were asked in previous years. I had made notes of that and revised from that only, which was enough. While giving an interview, you shouldn’t stutter and you should be confident in what you’re saying.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>12. How important are LinkedIn outreaches? Who should I mostly reach out to?</strong>
        <br>
        >> If you are interested in some job profiles or some particular areas, you should first research on the net what all companies are there which work on those areas and then start following those companies on LinkedIn as sometimes they may offer job openings on LinkedIn also. So, outreaches on LinkedIn are really helpful.

        <br><br>
        <strong>13. What do you think about free lancing as many students also do free lancing along with their academics?</strong>
        <br>
        >> You can do freelancing jobs if you are good at time management as you will be able to get good exposure in the corporate world. You can settle up in what you are doing or basically it may provide you a backup plan like if someone wouldn’t get a good placement but are good in freelancing then it’s really beneficial for them.

        <br>
        >> It has been great excluding those one and a half years of online college life. I was a part of Team Aveon and was a part of EEESoc since 2020. Currently I’m the Vice President of Team Aveon. Being a part of this team has taught me a lot of things including hard work, discipline and it also helped me in interacting with my seniors.

        <strong>3. What message would you give to the first and second year undergraduates on effectively using their time and maintaining their academic as well as social life?</strong>
        <br>
        >> First of all, it’s really important for you to explore all your interests and to interact well with your seniors because they would be the one who would not only guide you academically, but you will learn a lot of things that would help you somewhere in your life. Also, college life is something you only get only once so ensure that you enjoy as much as you can and be sincere at required times.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>4. How did you discover that “this particular sector” is suitable for me or I have interest in this? How did you carry forward in this?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I started coding like everyone else did in my first year but gradually I realised coding is something that doesn’t fascinate me as much. By the time first year passed, my inclination started shifting towards electronics when subjects like DSD, M&M, COA were introduced. And as the time passed, I realised electronics is something where my interest lies.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>5. Many of the students have interest in both core and software domain, what would you suggest to them?</strong>
        <br>
        >> In the beginning, when subjects of core and software are introduced, both seem interesting because you have just touched the surface and when you dig deep into the subjects only then you decide where your interest lies. So, it’s really important for you to explore properly.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>6. What is your advice to the juniors who want to get placed in the field you’ve chosen?</strong>
        <br>
        >> First of all, MATLAB is the most important and most extensively used software for EEE undergraduates. When it comes to preparation for core electronics companies like Synopsys or NXP, semester syllabus is not sufficient. The topics which are really important from the placement point of view are as follows: Analog and Digital Electronics, CMOS, VHDL, VLSI, COA, FIFO, Static Timing Analysis, M&M. Apart from these, you must solve the previous year GATE questions on analog and digital electronics.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>7. What was the selection procedure of your company? Can you repeat some of the important questions from each round of your interview?</strong>
        <br>
        >> There were 2 rounds including the HR round and the technical interview.
        <br>
        1st round was a written test which had 10 aptitude questions of medium difficulty, 40 questions were from digital electronics, 10 questions from analog electronics and approximately 10 questions were mixed from oops concepts, microprocessor, COA, etc.
        <br>
        2nd round was a technical interview in which both technical and HR related questions were asked, and some puzzles were also asked. All technical questions were at par with gate level questions.
        <br>
        Technical questions were mainly from digital electronics, circuit designing, and a lot of questions from static timing analysis were also asked. Some questions from Verilog were also asked.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>8. What are the projects you have done in 4 years and how did they help in your placement and internship?</strong>
        <br>
        >> I have done 2–3 major projects during my college that includes “Speed control of DC motor using Arduino” and “Modelling the control strategy of BLDC motor in MATLAB”. Both these projects were a part of SPP and SMP which were conducted by EEESoc itself. In my interview too, the major highlight of my resume was the “EV” that we built in Team Aveon.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>9. What are your future plans? Would you like to go for higher studies?</strong>
        <br>
        >> As of now, I would like to gain some experience in the industry and further ahead if this job seems monotonous, I could go for further studies.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>10. How much clubs and extracurricular activities matter in general as well as in context to placements?</strong>
        <br>
        >> Clubs and societies are an integral part of your development during your college life because not only you learn new skills, but you also improve your communication skills, and it boosts your confidence which is really important for the interviews. It would also help you answer the HR round situational questions as you might have experienced those scenarios earlier in the club.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>11. If an aspiring student couldn’t secure an on-campus internship, what recommendation do you have for that person both academically (off campus/ research internship) and mentally?</strong>
        <br>
        >>Don’t be disheartened, it’s alright if you didn’t grab an on-campus internship, you can utilise that time effectively and you can do some projects which would boost your resume. Otherwise, you can always apply for off campus internships, or you can do some research internship which would further enhance your technical knowledge.
